When Blackjack O'Hare betrayed his reptilian boss by keeping Lylla for himself, Dyvyne let loose his most dangerous creation, the Red Breath, to eliminate his enemies. However, in a twisted turn of events, the Red Breath was destroyed by a group of Killer Clowns on Vacuusleds. When it seemed as if he wouldn't be able to defeat the pesky raccoon on his own, Dyvyne chose to form an alliance with Jakes to first rid Halfworld of Rocket Raccoon and his allies, and then each mogul would rule one half of the planet. Jakes agreed, but the two couldn't get along for any extended amount of time.",
