Demogoblin directed the Doppelganger in a grudge against Hobgoblin, whom the altruistic Spider-Man protected. The foursome's fight brought them to another battle, where the supernatural heroes Ghost Rider and Blaze were fighting a group of demonic Deathspawn and Spider-Man's murderous nemesis Venom. Both the Doppelganger and Demogoblin were subsequently pulled underground by the Deathspawn, with two Deathspawn briefly taking up silent residence within the Doppelganger's body.",

It could climb walls with its claws, which could also rend most substances, as could its teeth. It could shoot razor-sharp webbing from its hands. Its innate ability to reshape its body in a virtually infinite manner enabled it to recover from all but the most severe injuries. It had the potential to duplicate others and take on their attributes, but it never demonstrated such power in the Earth dimension. The Doppelganger was created for the express purpose of fighting Spider-Man and held an innate hostility toward him. Roughly as intelligent as a wild beast, it was incapable of speech but achieved some level of learned response and primitive emotional attachment.",
