Recovering, Thog used the Tome of Zhered-Na and sent his demons to possess people on Earth, causing mass violence until Jennifer and the Man-Thing disrupted the spell with the aid of Dakimh the Enchanter. Thog then posed as the human Overmaster, joining forces with the Congress of Realities in an effort to merge all dimensions into a single realm; this disruption of the nexus of reality sent Howard of Duckworld and Korrek, warrior of Katharta, to Earth. Ultimately, Thog invaded Therea, but was petrified by immersion in its pure waters. Inspired by the Fear Lord Nox, Thog then used a number of Nightmare Boxes - filled with dark emotional energies - in a plot to plunge Earth into madness. However, the Man-Thing and writer Steve Gerber were pulled into a Box, and the presence of rational thought disrupted the delicate balance, foiling the scheme.",
