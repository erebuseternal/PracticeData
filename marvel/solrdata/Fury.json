    "content": "When Captain Britain of Earth-616 (Brian Braddock) and his companion Jackdaw arrived on Earth-238, the Fury was reactivated. It swiftly slew both of its new targets, though Captain Britain was reconstructed and returned to Earth-616 by Merlyn. Instinctively aware its job was incomplete, the Fury modified itself to pursue, unbothered by the raging reality warp Jaspers\u2019 mutant powers had precipitated; doggedly single minded, it survived the destruction of its entire reality performed to prevent Jaspers\u2019 warp from spreading to other timelines. Reaching Earth-616, it tracked its prey to Braddock Manor, coming upon the former Captain U.K. in the grounds, and would have slain her, had Merlyn not intervened. Captain Britain and his allies, the cross-dimensional mercenaries the Special Executive, engaged the Fury in battle; after sustaining a number of fatalities, they buried it under several tons of rock while it was temporarily confused by its inability to detect the temporally displaced Zeitgeist.The Fury dug its way out and pursued Captain Britain to London, unconcerned by reality once more breaking down due to Earth-616\u2019s version of Jaspers. Finding its target fighting 616\u2019s Jaspers, it reasoned this alternate Jaspers was not protected by the programming which had prevented it killing its creator, and attacked him. Having extensively improved itself during its pursuit of Captain Britain, the Fury proved capable of holding its own against Jaspers, finally transported them to the void where its own reality had once been. Lacking material to manipulate, Jaspers reverted to human form, and the Fury swiftly slew him. It returned to Earth-616, severely weakened, and Captain Britain and U.K. took the opportunity to destroy it before it could recover.The unfortunate Sidney Crumb subsequently mutated into a monster as a result of a near miss with the Fury when it first arrived on Earth-616, but otherwise the cybiote appeared to be gone for good. However, the X-Men recently found a version of the Fury in the caverns beneath Braddock Manor, which they later learned had been created by Jamie Braddock to test them. It fought the team to a standstill before they managed to send it into a miniature black hole. It (or a Fury dimensional counterpart from another reality in the multiverse) briefly managed to return to Earth-616, but was sent back into the interdimensional void through the combined efforts of Earth-9411's Captain Britain and Spider-Man.",

Lacking conscious thought, it used cold logic and highly attuned instinct in battle, learning from each encounter so that no attack on it worked twice. It could sense and track targets across dimensions, and developed the ability to travel inter-dimensionally. Its strength, reflexes, running speed and durability were superhuman, and it could rebuild itself using available materials so long as part of it remained intact.",
