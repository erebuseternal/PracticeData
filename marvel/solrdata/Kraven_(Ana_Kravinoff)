She then brought him to the underground lair of Vermin, and upon his arrival, Vermin attacked the intruder. Vin was injected by Ana with a Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH) to restore the super powers she assumed he had, but in doing so, Kraven only helped Vin to escape. He was eventually recaptured and hunted through the underground tunnels. While searching for Vin, the real Spider-Man borrowed a costume from Daredevil and ran afoul of Vermin, who led him to the tunnels. Parker and Gonzales held off Kraven until Vermin returned with an army of rats, and attacked her which allowed both men to escape.",
