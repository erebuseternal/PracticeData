While being nursed back to health in Castle Frankenstein, Velsing encountered the former Black Knight's winged horse, which Victoria had tried to restore to normal, but only succeeded in mutating it further. Using the horse and his scientific intellect, he decided to use his terrifying visage to seek vengeance on Doctor Doom with a new identity Dreadknight.",
