The wave did irreparable damage to the Kyln, and Aegis and Tenebrous were released back into the living universe once more, adding further fuel to the chaos that was engulfing all life. There were two other former powerful inmates freed from the Kyln, Kosmos the Maker formerly the Beyonder, and the Fallen One first Herald of Galactus. Tenebrous captured and drained the Fallen One of his power, leaving him as a lifeless husk. Thanos of Titan came to the rescue of the Fallen One. Thanos brokered a deal with Tenebrous for the return of the Fallen One.",
