As a mainstay of that super-youth group, Firestar grew into a formidable albeit reluctant champion, and she forged a lasting romance with fellow Warrior Justice, eventually following him to the legendary Avengers super-team he had long idolized. Shortly before joining the Avengers, Angelica had discovered that the microwave radiation she manipulated was threatening to render her sterile. This problem was solved by Hank Pym, who created a special suit to siphon off Firestar's excess radiation. Free from one of her greatest fears, Firestar resumed her adventures with renewed zeal. For a time, Firestar and Justice infiltrated he Triune Understanding spiritual movement at the behest of Avengers founder Iron Man. After the Triune's corrupt leadership was exposed and neutralized, the couple helped the Avengers thwart Kang's attempted conquest of Earth, then opted for Avengers reserve status to devote more time to their personal lives.",
