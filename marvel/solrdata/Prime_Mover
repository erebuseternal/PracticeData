The Grandmaster employed members of the Defenders, while the Prime Mover used the 30th Century cyborg Korvac and the extraterrestrial mercenaries the Minions of Menace. The Prime Mover had wagered the Earth, intending to prove its superiority to humanity, and they pitted their forces against each other on three different worlds. The Prime Mover believed that it was simply a contest of power, and had chosen its contestant accordingly, predicting victory, but the Defenders won 2 of the 3 games, and the Prime Mover broke down, unable to cope with its defeat. Grandmaster lost his claim to Earth when Daredevil tricked him into a rigged coin toss.",
