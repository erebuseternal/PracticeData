After Spiral, Gog and Magog failed in capturing Longshot, Mojo had finally decided to find Longshot himself, along with Spiral. Mojo failed in his attempt and was sent back to the Mojoverse by Longshot, with help from Ricochet Rita, Quark, and Doctor Strange. Longshot decided it was time to return to his home planet and free the slaves. This time Ricochet Rita and Quark came along with him. But Longshot's rebelion failed to overthrow the Spinless Ones.Longshot returned to Earth and joined the X-Men. A relationship between fellow X-Man, Dazzler, soon surfaced and the two were later married. The couple returned to Mojoworld to lead another rebellion. This time it seemed they had succeeded in freeing the slaves. The planet was once again at peace, and the couple decided to make the planet their permanent home. While in Mojoworld, Longshot and Dazzler looked after a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men named the X-Babies. Mojo returned to the Mojoverse and reclaimed himeslf as the ruler of the planet. Longshot once again became a rebel leader against the slavemasters. Phoenix  discovered that Dazzler had become pregnant with Longshot\u2019s baby, but the baby's fate remains unrevealed.Dazzler returned from the Mojoverse without Longshot by her side. She claimed Mojoworld was completely destroyed as a result of \"X-Baby\" versions of villains that were spawned from the Age of Apocalypse. The baby versions of Apocalypse, Holocaust, Dark Beast, and the Sugar Man had completely destroyed the entire Mojoverse, including, she claimed, her husband Longshot.",
