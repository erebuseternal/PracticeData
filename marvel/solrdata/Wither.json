While Kevin was still angry at Dani, Emma managed to persuade him to return, and he joined the New Mutants squad under the codename Wither. Clashing with Elixir, the current object of Laurie's affections who he'd last seen as one of Pierce's Reavers, Mercury, the only person he could touch without killing, reached out to him, having developed a crush on him. Shortly after he returned to the school he was arrested by the FBI for killing his father. While the Hellions tried to \"rescue\" him (Mercury coming in through a window to let him know), the New Mutants tried to stop them - fearing the consequences of involving the Institute in a fight with the FBI - until the X-Men arrived and ended the fight, taking them all back to the Institute before they were discovered. This was the final straw, however, and he swapped squads with Icarus to become a Hellion.Recently, he discovered Elixir's former relationship with Wolfsbane and released it to the school, successfully ending Josh's relationship with Laurie.\nDuring M-Day, when most of the world's mutants lost their powers, Kevin mistakenly thought he had lost his powers also. He touched Laurie's hand making it withered and after feeling more guilty and depressed he ran away from the Institute.",
