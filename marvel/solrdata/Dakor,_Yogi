Being young, Johnny didn\u2019t question it, and he showed up to claim his car. Dakor drove him away and claimed to be taking him to the maharajah, but instead trapped him in the fireproof car to bring him to Doctor Doom. The Torch tried to heat up the inside but failed, as it and Dakor were fireproof. Dakor then pushed a button on the dashboard that released a powerful nerve gas, and after he donned a gas mask, Dakor drove the unconscious Torch to his master.",
