In prison, Melissa met wrestler Marian Pouncy who brought her into the costumed wrestling team the Grapplers as \"Screaming Mimi\". The Grapplers moonlighted as criminals and were cybernetically enhanced by Roxxon Oil, who had hired them to invade the government's Project: PEGASUS facility, but they were defeated by Quasar and Giant-Man.Screaming Mimi eventually left the Grapplers, serving in Helmut Zemo's Masters of Evil and partnering with the similarly powered Angar the Screamer; however, Angar was killed during a robbery and a grieving Mimi went on a screaming rampage that destroyed her voice. She was rescued by Zemo, who recruited her back into his Masters and had the Fixer grant her new abilities based on Klaw's Sonic Horn. When Zemo's new Masters disguised themselves as the heroic Thunderbolts, Melissa adopted the identity of Songbird and became romantically involved with teammate Abe Jenkins, alias M.A.C.H. 1, who trained her in aerial combat.",
