Red Shift is currently allied with Firelord and Stardust in opposing the forces of Annihilus. While in battle with Anihilus's forces on the planet Daedalus 5, Red Shift and Stardust detected the presence of Galactus, who had been turned into a weapon by Thanos. In order to give Nova and his remaining forces time to evacuate, Red Shift and Stardust seemingly sacrificed themselves by delaying the destruction of Daedalus 5 by temporarily holding back the cosmic energies of Galactus before they could consume the planet. Red Shift has not been seen since the incident and is presumed deceased.",
