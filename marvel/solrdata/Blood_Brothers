Quasar for some unknown reason convinced the Warden to release them into his custody so that they could participate in a battle arena. He takes them to Mars where the Brothers pound unmercifully on Quasar, until Wonder Man contacts him to inform him that Makkari is on the move. Quasar uses the power of the quantum bands to form to giant hands, which he uses to help him, escape. The Blood Brothers are left stranded on Mars.They managed to escape their exile and one of the brothers appeared in a bar on Earth where he fought the U.S.Agent. The Agent easily defeated the one brother. After that it was learned that the Living Planet Ego was about to attack the Earth. The U.S.Agent enlisted the Blood Brothers and a bunch of other aliens to help him battle Ego and an enhanced race of Kree known as the Ruul. Together with the help of the heroes of Earth the Blood Brothers were able to help save the planet.",
