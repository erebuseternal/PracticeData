Once inside, Harrow could manipulate the being's biology to suit his needs such as forming claws from fingers, and it enhanced the host body's strength and speed. Harrow was so powerful that even a being with significant defenses against psionic attacks could not resist when in the presence of his true form. Even Galactus did not detect Harrow's existence aboard his ship while Harrow was hidden in his Cone of Psilence, a psychic shield that prevents detection apparently from even the most powerful beings.",
