The Thanosi empowered several servants, including the Plasmagen Primo and Cap'n Reptyl, to bring him the Celestial Messiah, but it was the pirate Raptra who succeeded in capturing Quoi, hoping to use him to save her from the wrath of the Thanosi. When the Thanosi refused to bargain with her, Raptra found herself making an uneasy alliance with Quoi, taking refuge in a region of space known as the Rot, where the unholy spawn of Death and the Thanosi was consuming space. There they came face-to-face with both the Avengers (who now had a new reality displaced ally, Haywire) and the Thanosi. After battling the Thanosi on the Astral plane, Quoi came to terms with his feelings towards his mother and joined with her to oppose the incursion of the deadly Rot, which destroyed all it touched. Quoi failed in his attempt to drive back the Rot, but after the Thanosi destroyed it with the help of Death, Quoi elected to remain in the region, helping bring new life to the decimated area of space. At his side was Raptra, the saurian pirate who was inspired by his nobility and for whom he had proclaimed his love.",
