It was only after Molten Man made an attempt to attack her, he realized that his step-sister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. After desperate attempts to cure himself involving criminal activities, Raxton ended up in the Vault, the superhuman prison in the Colorado Rockies.Years later, reconciling with Raxton, Liz and her husband Harry Osborn gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries. Raxton supported Liz when Harry went back his villainous ways and later helped Spider-Man to capture him. Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, but when Ben Reilly assumed the role of Spider-Man they have minor disagreement until they allied themselves against Gaunt.Raxton also crossed paths with Daredevil when he was affected by a gas made by Mister Fear. Daredevil managed to dispose the gas before he managed to hurt anyone and revealed that Raxton was betrayed by one of his own people.Some time after that, Molten Man was abducted by Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, and was brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchwoman Alison Mongrain, who happened to be one of the few people who knew the true cause Mary Jane's miscarriage. While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.",
