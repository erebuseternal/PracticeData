Morph joined Rogue's team of X-Men in Chicago to evacuate as many humans as possible and stop Holocaust. When Wild Child was attacked by Infinites, Morph changed into Holocaust to deceive the Infinites long enough for Sunfire to kill them. Wild Child, unable to speak, licked Rogue in order for her to absorb his memories and to inform her of the danger Sabretooth was in. Sneaking into the Infinite processing plant, Morph and the rest of the X-Men managed to rescue some prisoners and destroy the plant, preventing further Infinites from being processed. During the battle with Holocaust, Rogue was hurt and Morph, as a means to get her interest, changed to Rogue's son, Charles. Doing the trick, Rogue, Morph and the rest of the team managed to defeat Holocaust and rescue Sabretooth.",
