The Ka stone can alter reality within a several mile radius. It allows Meryet to project blast of force, heat and light from her eyes or hands or from the stone, create elaborate illusions, teleport over long distances, and enhance her own strength, resistance and lifespan. The stone can also be used to read minds, as well as drain someone's entire memory, killing them. When deprived of the Ka stone's energies, the holder loses its power, even to the point of assuming their true age and crumbling to dust if unprepared.",
