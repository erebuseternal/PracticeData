She commanded Milago's finest warrior \u2013 Lyra, daughter of Thundra and Hulk \u2013 to journey to the realm of men and seize a replacement part to repair the Cradle. Lyra did as she was told, but a bitter betrayal put her at odds with the Gynosure. While on the mission, one of Lyra's soldiers attacked her, saying Gynosure wanted the male element from the Sisterhood removed. Lyra defended herself and killed her attacker in the process, but she would soon have words with the Gynosure.",
