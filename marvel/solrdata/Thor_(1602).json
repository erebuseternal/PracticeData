But Doom\u2019s men soon cornered them, after Donal recovered his staff, and against his beliefs, Donal used the staff to turn into the Thunder God, Thor. As Thor, Donal used his powers to bring down a massive thunderstorm, which Javier\u2019s student Robert used to increase his ice powers enough to freeze Doom\u2019s cannons. Doom also used Thor\u2019s lightning to power the sphere he held, to use against the escaped group from the Fantastick, but it backfired and exploded in his face, scarring him severely and brought him to the point of death. Donal then joined the group of heroes and used Thor\u2019s powers to fly their ship to the ocean, so that they could travel to the New World and stop their universe\u2019s swiftly approaching destruction.",
