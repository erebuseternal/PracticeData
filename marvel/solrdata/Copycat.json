Later, Carlysle sought to live a peaceful life in San Francisco with Garrison Kane, but she soon encountered Deadpool again. Carlysle was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating Psycho-Man, who sought Kane\u2019s advanced technology, but was rescued from the Microverse by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse\u2019s resident heroes, the Microns. Returning to Earth, Carlysle finally made peace with Domino.",
