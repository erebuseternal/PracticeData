It turned out that he had injected himself with serums of various animal stem cells, causing him to be engulfed into a large flesh like chrysalis. Carlie ran test on the chrysalis and discovered that it was highly corrosive and destroyed whatever it came into contact with, although when Freak emerged from the chrysalis lost its corrosive abilities and she was able to gather samples. Carlie would later share the samples with Professor Connors.",
