And when Sham used her illusions to distract them, they weren\u2019t fooled, but the X-Men\u2019s Meanstreak appeared in time to disable them and save Quiver and Sham.  But when they explained that they were going back in, Quiver got scared and refused to step foot back in the Theatre, causing more seismic activity with his barely controlled powers.  Though when the X-Men went in alone, Sham convinced Quiver to follow them in and help them against the mutant Zhao\u2019s X-Men.  Quiver used his seismic powers to shake Zhao\u2019s One-Eyed Jack and force him to misfire his optic blasts, disabling his teammate, Psycho K.  With the help of their old leader Xi\u2019an Chi Xan, later shocked back out of his criminal mindset, the X-Men destroyed the Theatre and President Doom appeared and offered them Halo City, a refuge built for the Theatre's victims.  When the X-Men traveled there, both Quiver and Sham joined them, happy to finally find a home.",
