Desperate to get out from under his fathers thumb, he bailed the media-savvy super-criminal Screwball out of jail and hired her to impersonate Spider-Man in a stage battle with his other hireling Basher. When the real Spider-Man arrived, the Bookies, deception was revealed, upsetting criminals like Scorpia, and Lightmaster, but neither of them were as angry as the Enforcers' OX (Raymond Bloch), Montana (Jackson Brice), and Fancy Dan (Daniel Brito). The trio kidnapped Bookie and took him to Conney Island, where they terrorized him until he was rescued by his father and Spider-Man.",
