After the ceremony, Talos came in contact with the Hulk, an incredibly strong Earthling, who is famed as one of the Earth's most unstable heroes. Talos instigated a fight hoping his honor would be restored, if his death was by the hands of a worthy foe. The battle was being watched by a group of Skrulls on Talos' ship orbiting the Earth; they cheered for the defeat of their lowly Skrull brother. Talos battled the Hulk using his enhanced strength and a very powerful battle axe. Hulk however refused to participate in Talos' suicide attempt. The battle ended with the Hulk begging for his life as part of a plan to avoid succumbing to violence. The disgusted Talos returned to the ship with his fellow Skrulls newly loyal to him.",
