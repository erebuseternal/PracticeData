Whitemane knew that a device such as Power's, although Power and his co-workers did not realize it, would trigger a chain reaction that would destroy the Earth. Moreover, he knew that Power's device was sought by the alien Z^nrx, nicknamed \"Snarks,\" who intended to use it to conquer inhabited worlds. Snarks captured Dr. Power and his wife Margaret, intending to force him to reveal the secret of how his device worked. Whitemane saved the Powers' children, Alex, Julie, Jack, and Katie, from being captured, but he himself was fatally wounded in the process. Dying, Whitemane transferred a different one of his superhuman powers into each of the four Power children and asked them to use their new abilities to save their world. Julie received the power to fly at great speed whileleaving a trail of colored light behind her, and therefore called herself Lightspeed. The four children called themselves the Power Pack. Power Pack thwarted the Snarks, rescued their parents, and destroyed Dr. Power's dangerous matter/antimatter converter, thereby saving the Earth from destruction. The four children continued to have adventures as Power Pack.",
