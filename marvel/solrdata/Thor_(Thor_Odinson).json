    "content": "The young Thor grew up alongside his adopted brother Loki, the trickster, who was always jealous of his more favored sibling. Thor grew in power and popularity and on his eighth birthday, Odin had the hammer Mjolnir created for him, enchanting it with powerful magic. Odin decreed that Mjolnir would be presented to Thor when his son had been proven a worthy warrior. After spending the next eight years training and performing heroic deeds, Thor was given the hammer and declared the greatest warrior in Asgard.After 10 years on Earth, Blake received a subconscious prodding from Odin to vacation in Norway where alien Kronans were preparing to invade Earth. Fleeing into a cave (which, unbeknownst to him, was also his birthplace) Blake discovered a plain walking cane in a secret chamber. When Blake struck the cane against a boulder, he transformed into Thor while the cane became Mjolnir. Thor fought against the Kronans and their invasion was thwarted. Tapping the ground with Mjolnir, Thor was able to transform back into Don Blake, holding the simple wooden cane once again.Blake returned to New York, using his secret identity of Thor to fight crime, defend Earth and contend with the jealous and hateful Loki, who plagued Thor with many devious tricks and outright confrontation. One such trick led Thor and other heroes, including Ant-Man (Hank Pym), the Wasp (Janet van Dyne), and Iron Man (Tony Stark) to fight the Hulk (Bruce Banner). Learning of Loki\u2019s manipulations, the heroes, along with the Hulk, bested Loki and agreed to continue their partnership, forming the Avengers.While Thor faced many struggles as an Avenger, his personal life as a human was also tumultuous. Despite the sincere love between Blake and Foster, Odin was displeased by the relationship between a god and a mortal. He forbade Blake from revealing his identity to her, creating a strange love triangle between Foster, Thor and Thor\u2019s alter-ego, Blake.Even though Donald Blake knew he was the legendary Thor, he still lacked his full memories from his former life as an Asgardian. However, over time his memories slowly returned, until one day Odin finally revealed himself and restored Thor\u2019s complete memory.  Odin also admitted his role orchestrating Blake\u2019s trip to Norway to discover his Asgardian alter-ego. Thor was reintroduced to his childhood friend and former lover, the Asgardian warrior Sif, further complicating Thor\u2019s love life on Earth.The love affair between Thor and Jane Foster eventually ended when Foster fell in love with a mortal man, Dr. Keith Kincaid. Resuming their ancient romance, Sif and Thor were betrothed, and Sif lived on Earth posing as Donald Blake\u2019s cousin. Foster and Kincaid married, but wedding plans were cancelled for Thor, as Sif grew bored with his time spent as Blake, and returned to Asgard.File:MikeFichera--Thor-and-BetaRay.jpgThe fire demon Surtur, enemy of the Asgardian gods, ravaged a distant galaxy (the \"Burning Galaxy\") for the sake of forging his Twilight Sword, the \"Sword of Doom.\" A fleet of survivors of the galactic massacre from the planet Korbin traveled the cosmos in search of a new home, under the protection of their noble guardian, Beta Ray Bill. As the fleet ventured close to Earth, Thor mistook them for a threat and attacked the Korbinites. Separated from Mjolnir, Thor reverted into Donald Blake, while Beta Ray Bill retrieved and wielded the hammer, magically unliftable to all but the most worthy. With Donald Blake helpless and defeated, Bill made a claim to keep the hammer to help him fight back against Surtur\u2019s demons. Odin had Thor and Beta Ray Bill compete for the right to use the hammer and Beta Ray Bill won, but Odin awarded him with a similar weapon, Stormbreaker, rather than disarm his son. Once Thor, Bill, and Sif defeated Surtur\u2019s demons, Odin transferred the enchantment that changed Thor into Donald Blake onto Stormbreaker, so that Bill could revert to his mortal form. Thor, therefore, abandoned his Donald Blake identity, and resided in Asgard. He and Bill still successfully teamed together to vanquish Surtur when the demon led an assault against Asgard and Earth. Afterward, Bill departed with his people to find a new home.After commuting back and forth from Asgard to Earth to continue his heroic adventures with humans, Thor sought help from Nick Fury, director of the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D., to create another human identity to enable him to live among humans. A new alias was created, that of construction worker Sigurd Jarlson. However, Thor infrequently used the guise, consumed by his adventures as Thor.After being defeated by Thor and Beta Ray Bill, the vengeful Surtur made an alliance with the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim (one of the realms of Asgard) to war against the Asgardian gods. Thor, Loki, and Odin protected Asgard by merging their spiritual essences together, thereby increasing their powers. However, the battle could not be won until Odin sacrificed himself for Asgard, seemingly dying as he grappled Surtur and plummeted into a huge chasm. With Asgard left without a leader, Loki schemed for ways to assume power. Working in collusion with Loki, the Asgardian goddess Lorelei (a notorious seductress like her sister Amora the Enchantress), cast a spell on Thor causing him to fall in love with her in hopes that he would then help Loki become the new ruler. Thor broke free of the enchantment, but the incident strained Thor's relationship with Sif, who still loved the thunder-god.As the gods of Asgard performed the \"Great Althing,\" a ceremony to choose a new leader to replace Odin, Loki continued to scheme to seize Asgard\u2019s throne for himself. He incapacitated Thor by turning him into a frog on Earth. As a heroic amphibian, Thor became embroiled in a battle between the frogs and the rats of Central Park, New York, until he turned into a frog-like humanoid upon finding his hammer. Meanwhile in Asgard, Harokin, an Asgardian warrior, pretended to be Thor so as to cast his vote for Loki. Thor captured Loki and Thor\u2019s friend Volstagg returned him to his normal form. Thor was offered his father\u2019s seat, but declined the throne, nominating Balder as Asgard\u2019s new leader.File:MikeFichera--Kurse-vs-Thor.jpgA Dark Elf named Algrim the Strong defended his ruler, Malekith the Accursed, from Thor when the thunder-god attempted to rescue Lorelei from capture. Malekith dropped both Thor and Algrim into a chasm towards molten lava. While Thor escaped, Algrim was badly burned and left an amnesiac with nothing but vengeance against Thor on his mind. The near-omnipotent being called the Beyonder, curious about human desires, transformed Algrim into Kurse, healing his injuries, augmented his strength, and remodeling his armor. Kurse wreaked havoc searching for Thor in Manhattan. Assisted by the junior super-team Power Pack, Thor defeated Kurse, reawakening his memories in the process. Kurse realized it was Malekith, not Thor, who caused his fall, and redirected his anger. At Thor\u2019s request, the Beyonder sent Kurse to Hel to find Malektih, where Hela, the Asgardian death goddess, grew furious with Kurse\u2019s rampage through her realm. Kurse eventually found Malekith in Asgard and slew him. In retaliation, Hela cursed Thor such that his bones became brittle, yet he was prevented from dying from his injuries. Humiliated but determined to remain a warrior to the end, Thor donned a suit of battle armor to support his fragile body.Loki took this opportunity to release the Midgard Serpent, the beast prophesized to kill Thor and start Ragnarok, the apocalyptic end of the Asgardians. Despite his weakened condition, Thor was able to kill the Midgard Serpent and, thanks to Hela\u2019s curse, Thor survived the battle although his body was completely broken and battered. Loki then sent the enchanted Destroyer, an animated indestructible suit of armor, to torment Thor but instead, Thor managed to send his spirit into the Destroyer armor and take command of it. He traveled to Hel in the Destroyer and began wreaking havoc. The desperate Hela had no choice but to fully restore Thor\u2019s original body and release him from her curse.After a battle between Asgard and the Egyptian god of death, Seth, which resulted in Odin triumphantly returned to the throne of Asgard, Thor began to suffer sudden and momentary bouts of weakness during times of stress. Travelling within Thor\u2019s mind, Doctor Stephen Strange the Sorcerer Supreme, discovered an evil version of Thor present, derived from Loki\u2019s evil residue which had manifested when Thor, Loki, and Odin had mingled their essences to battle Surtur. Thor defeated his evil alternate version within himself.Thor, in his civilian identity of Jarlson, had become friends with the architect Eric Masterson and his son, Kevin. Eric was kidnapped by Mongoose (a superhuman agent of the powerful scientist, the High Evolutionary) who had previously attacked Thor, attempting to gain a cell sample. Thor tracked Eric to the High Evolutionary\u2019s European base at Mount Wundagore, where Mongoose led the animalistic residents to attack. Freeing Eric, Thor learned that the High Evolutionary and the Greek demigod Hercules were missing. Accompanied by Eric, Thor rescued Hercules and the High Evolutionary from the ancient galactic entities, the Celestials, in the Black Galaxy. Upon returning to Earth, they were again attacked by the Mongoose, and Eric blocked a blast of energy meant for Thor, giving Thor and Hercules a chance to defeat Mongoose.With Eric dying from Mongoose\u2019s attack, Thor pleaded with Odin for aid on Eric\u2019s behalf. Odin reluctantly agreed to save him, but did so by merging Thor and Masterson together, body and soul.Thor and Eric shared a body in the same manner in which Donald Blake and Thor had, although the latter two were never truly separate beings. They dealt with their new condition, despite the problems it caused for Eric's private life and custody of his son. Thor continued his adventures, plagued by Loki. Eventually, the two\u2019s bodies were separated by a Celestial while they were involved in the birth of a new Celestial in the Black Galaxy. During a tremendous battle between the fiery Surtur and the frost giant Ymir, a battle that signaled Ragnarok and the end of the Asgardians, Thor recovered Surtur's powerful sword from the Sea of Eternal Night to oppose the elemental giants. Weakened by his separation from Masterson, Thor was easily stopped by Surtur and Ymir, but Masterson willingly merged with Thor again, even though it meant giving up part of his life. While Ymir and Surtur fought over the sword, Thor opened a dimensional rift that sucked them both into the Sea of Eternal Night, ending the threat of Ragnarok.When Thor returned to Earth, he quickly found himself in battle with Loki over the fate of Kevin Masterson. Although Thor defeated Loki, the trickster fired one last blast at Kevin and his mother Marcy, but it was blocked by Eric\u2019s secretary, Susan Austin, killing her. Angered as never before, Thor absorbed all of Loki's lifeforce with his hammer, seemingly destroying the evil god forever, despite breaking Odin's sacred rule forbidding Asgardian gods from killing each other.However, this was all according to Loki\u2019s plan with the Hell-lord Mephisto. Loki\u2019s spirit was able to possess Odin while Odin\u2019s spirit was sent to Mephisto\u2019s realm in exchange. Posing as Odin, Loki exiled Thor into Eric\u2019s subconscious mind, though Eric could still assume Thor's form after striking his cane. Loki\u2019s decrees while in Odin\u2019s body became increasingly irrational and oppressive. Eric, Balder and Sif discovered Loki\u2019s deception and rescued Odin and reclaimed his body from Loki. Mephisto seized Loki\u2019s soul, allegedly his true goal. Eric then freed Thor\u2019s spirit from within himself. For Eric\u2019s courageous efforts, Odin granted him an enchanted uru mace. Still able to transform into a version of Thor, Eric adopted a new separate heroic identity, Thunderstrike.This experience sparked Thor\u2019s anger at his father regarding his discipline of humility. He left Asgard, allying with the High Evolutionary and his newly created godlike beings, the Godpack.  In the meantime, Odin decided that the time had come for Ragnarok to begin, and he needed Thor. Disowning Thor, Odin resurrected Red Norvell, who once held the mantle of thunder god but had died in battle, and re-made him into a new \"Thor.\" Odin also divulged the truth to his son about Donald Blake, that he and Thor were never separate beings. Thor became enraged and severed his ties with Asgard.Odin hoped to bypass Ragnarok by transforming the Asgardian gods into mortals, but his plan was hijacked by the Egyptian god Seth, and put it into action prematurely. Asgard fell, and its gods were banished to Earth. Odin hoped Thor would restore the gods to power, but before he could, Thor fell in battle with the psychic entity, Onslaught. Thor vanished, along with the Avengers and other heroes, but, was merely reborn to another dimension, Counter-Earth. He eventually returned through the reality altering power of the boy Franklin Richards, son of the Fantastic Four\u2019s Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman.When Thor returned, he discovered Asgard had been claimed held captive by the cruel Dark Gods (beings formerly banished by the Asgardians to the farthest reaches of the universe). They sent the Destroyer to Earth on a rampage, leaving the Avengers defeated and Thor nearly dead. The mysterious being named Marnot (secretly Hescamar, one of Odin\u2019s magical ravens) offered to restore Thor in exchange for taking the place of Jake Olsen, a paramedic who died during the battle. Thor agreed, fighting the Destroyer again and banishing it to another dimension. Thor found he could transform between himself and Olsen, although he had none of Olsen\u2019s memories, making it difficult to maintain two identities.The Dark Gods, in the guise of Asgardians, attacked Olympus and left it in ruins. Thor and Hercules uncovered the truth and led the battle against the Dark Gods, eventually freeing both Asgard and Olympus, restoring them to glory. Marnot revealed that the Dark Gods had once invaded Asgard ages ago, and Odin had prepared an enchantment on Hescamar to seek out a way to defeat the Dark Gods should they return. The raven fulfilled this by transforming into Marnot and helping Thor. Afterwards, Thor remained on Earth with his dual identity of Jake Olsen.Among his subsequent adventures, Thor rescued a woman named Tarene, a cosmic being also known as the Designate. She later took on the identity of Thor Girl out of admiration of Thor. Thor and Thor Girl battled the time-travelling Gladiator (Kallark), who vowed to destroy Thor in a preemptive strike to prevent a terrible horror that he believed Thor would inflict in the future.While Thor failed to defend Asgard against an army of monstrous Asgardian trolls during one of Odin\u2019s \"Odinsleeps\" (a time when Odin recharges his energy and is left vulnerable), Odin punished Thor, stripping him of his immortality and left him on Earth. Shortly afterward, Loki (who had escaped Mephisto\u2019s captivity) brought the Destroyer back to Earth, animating it with the soul of Tarene. Ultimately, the Destroyer was thwarted and Tarene was restored, but during the battle, Thor was severely wounded. Dr. Jane Foster tended to Jake Olsen's wounds but was unable to treat Thor's. Odin brought Thor to Asgard and physically separated Thor from his alter ego to allow Thor to heal while Jake Olsen was returned to his life on Earth.Later on, Surtur appeared on Earth and an assemblage of Asgardian heroes and allies confronted the demon and its hordes. Tarene used her powers to restore Thor to full health, joining with Odin and the Asgardian warriors against Surtur. In the end, Odin tapped into both Thor and Tarene's powers to deliver a fatal blow against Surtur, but sacrificed himself in the process.In mourning the loss of his father, Thor initially refused to take Odin's place. Eventually a discussion with Jake Olsen convinced Thor to accept the responsibilities of the new monarch of Asgard. Thor did so, gaining his father\u2019s might, the \"Odinpower,\" as a right of rule.Almost immediately after restoring Asgard to its own realm away from Earth, Thor was attacked by Loki and his armies, who had teamed with Surtur to create weapons for Thor\u2019s enemies, forged in the same way as Mjolnir. The fight for Asgard escalated into Ragnarok. Although Thor managed to defeat Loki, severing his head, the war left many of Thor\u2019s allies dead, including Sif and his friends \"the Warriors Three.\" Thor forced Surtur to re-forge Mjolnir, which had shattered during the battle. While Asgard succumbed to Ragnarok, effectively wiping the Asgardian world from existence, Thor sought out the gods known as Those Who Sit Above In Shadow, who gained power from repeating Ragnarok and Asgardian rebirth throughout history. Thor refused an offer to join them. Confronting them in battle, Thor destroyed Those Who Sit Above In Shadow as Asgard died. The Odinpower congratulated Thor on succeeding at his greatest mission. Thor then closed his eyes, apparently joining his people in death.",
