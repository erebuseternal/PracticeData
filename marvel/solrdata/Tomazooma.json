It sprayed Wyatt with a deadly vapor after he fired his gun at it to no effect, and Wyatt crawled away, trying to reach his vehicle. The robot then went after the tribe\u2019s oil fields and burned them down until the Human Torch appeared to absorb the flames. The false Tomazooma attacked the Torch, using beams from its eyes to knock him unconscious. The Thing then leapt onto the robot\u2019s back and drove it to the ground until the robot used a power blast to throw Ben off of it. Mister Fantastic attacked next, using his Pogo Plane\u2019s guns, but the robot simply used a build up of energy to reflect the bullets back at him, which sent his plane plummeting to Earth.",
