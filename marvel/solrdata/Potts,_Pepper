Tony began to assume more of his responsibilities and eased the pressure off of Pepper, but still valued her contributions to the company. Pepper became infatuated with Tony, but he distanced himself from her emotionally because of his secret reliance upon the Iron Man armor to keep himself alive. Tony soon hired ex-boxer Harold \"Happy\" Hogan as his chauffeur. Happy was immediately attracted to Pepper and pursued her romantically, but Pepper repeatedly rejected his advances. However, when Happy was nearly killed aiding Iron Man against the Titanium Man, Pepper realized that she loved him. Eventually, they were married and left Stark Industries.The couple fell on hard times. After adopting children, they lost custody since Happy was unable to keep a steady job. Pepper and Happy experienced marital problems over the years, and eventually divorced. They both returned to Tony's employ when he started up his business Stark Solutions (now both aware that he was Iron Man). Although Pepper found herself drawn to Tony again, their relationship remained platonic. Over time, she and Happy reconciled and remarried. The couple tried to start a family and Pepper became pregnant, but before she could tell Happy, she was assaulted by Iron Man's enemy Ayisha and lost the baby. Pepper withheld telling Happy about her miscarriage, which created new barriers to their relationship. Happy suffered brain damage after a fight with the Spymaster (Sinclair Abbot) that left him in a coma. Pepper requested that Tony turn off his life support as an act of mercy and Tony eventually complied.",
