    "content": "Learning the ExTechOp division was using Cable in experiments to create controllable, artificial intelligent agents, and desiring a fair rematch, Truman freed Cable, but during their subsequent fight, a ruptured turbine bathed Truman in burning fuel. He clung to life, ironically handed over to ExTechOp, who put him through inhuman experiments; with sight his only remaining sense, Truman tried a Tibetan technique to bounce his psyche into S.H.I.E.L.D. employee Ted Bailey, then inadvertently into Ted\u2019s six year old son Billy. Meanwhile his body\u2019s brain and nervous system were transplanted into a new Deathlok cyborg, built using technology harvested from Machine Man; when the Nazi Red Skull invaded the Helicarrier, Douglock activated Deathlok and later released him into the outside world. The mindless cyborg rampaged through Las Vegas, pursued by Larry Young\u2019s Air Cavalry and Zero Company, until \u201cBilly Bailey\u201d arrived to reclaim his body.",
