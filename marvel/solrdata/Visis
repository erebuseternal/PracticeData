Fearing an inevitable defeat on the horizon, Jarella commanded the Triad of Sorcerers to teleport her to Earth's dimension in hopes of returning with the Hulk to thwart the upstart to her throne. Witnessing the Triads efforts to bring his plans to a halt, Visis used his formidable magic to manipulate the spell allowing him to send the Fialan, Master Assassin of the Pitll Pawob, after Jarella. Fialan battled the Hulk and was gravely wounded. He and Jarella returned to K'ai.",
