Teaming up with Daredevil the pair were able to stop Purge.This act gave the new hero a lot of attention and he developed a small but devoted following. Liz Allan asked Ben for information on who was using her husband's former identity. She later gave Phil her \"blessing\" after he saved her and her son Normie from Angel Face.During Onslaught's attack, the Goblin costume was heavily damaged and the glider destroyed after battling Sentinels. Phil soon decided to retire as an active hero, and continue his college education at Empire State University.",
