He attacked Repyl, who tore out his throat (though Kl\u2019rt faked his death as part of S\u2019Byil\u2019s secret plans). While Reptyl planned a Kree ambush, he was stabbed from behind and left for dead by his first mate Clumsy Foulup (under the influence of the disembodied Contemplator impostor), ending his involvement in the Kree-Skrull War. Recovering, Reptyl sought vengeances on Foulup, but was attacked by the Super Skrull (who could no longer bear the dishonored of his faked death), strangled and cast into space.In rare generations of Reptyl\u2019s race, there exist a \u201cprime\u201d whose genes contained evolutionary keys. Upon physical death, Reptyl formed a cocoon and transformed into Reptyl Prime. He began flying home, intending to propagate a super-reptilian race that would eradicate humanoid life. Pausing at the mad Titan Thanos\u2019 former monument to Death, Reptyl Prime encountered and battled the Silver Surfer. Outmatched despite his increased power, Reptyl took hostage Kharta\u2019een princess Alaisa Ruantha Pethnan and then fled. Reverting to normal, Reptyl was imprisoned and eventually sent to Earth by the Intergalactic Council as part of their \u201cMaximum Security\u201d plot to occupy humanity with extraterrestrial criminals.",
