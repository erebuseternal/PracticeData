Aided by Valinor, the Avengers retrieved Dolan\u2019s original Ebony Blade, restoring him to a more human state. Later, while Dolan was doing voluntary humanitarian work in the destroyed country Slorenia, the Blade somehow drew power from the souls of the recently slaughtered Slorenian populace, and transformed Dolan into a savage, unstoppable giant.  The Avengers were unable to defeat him, and the Scarlet Witch was unable to severe Dolan\u2019 link to the Slorenian souls; so instead, she strengthened his bond, making it impossible for Bloodwraith to leave Slorenian territory.  The mad giant has been trapped in the deserted country ever since, monitored by SHIELD and the Avengers.",
