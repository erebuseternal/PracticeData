According to Skrull religion, this was the spawning ground of Sl\u2019gur\u2019t, the Skrull God of War.  But, more importantly Zarags\u2019na was the home world of Sarnogg, the only son of Super Skrull. This led to Super Skrull leading a ragtag army of escaped prisoners from the Negative Zone UX-73 prison planetoid. Praxagora and Preak were among this group of escaped warriors. Together they defeated the evil twisted scientist to Annihilus, Lord Hawl.",
