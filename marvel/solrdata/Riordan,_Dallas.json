Fleeing the Battalion, she was defended by the Thunderbolts, then abducted by the Crimson Cowl, who left her crippled and stranded in Latveria after a fierce battle. When Dallas returned to America, she learned Atlas had died; however, he survived as ionic energy, and her love served as an anchor that bound him to the material world. They soon merged, with the disembodied Atlas sharing control of Dallas\u2019s body and imbuing her with ionic powers. The combined pair fought Graviton alongside the Thunderbolts and were stranded with them on Counter-Earth. The Thunderbolts helped Counter-Earth recover from various disasters but ultimately returned to their home world where Atlas and Dallas were unmerged. As a result Atlas gained a new body and Dallas gained new powers.Now calling herself Vantage, Dallas remained with the Thunderbolts out of love for Atlas and distrust of their leader, Baron Zemo. She cooperated with Zemo in a scheme to absorb the world\u2019s transnormal energy, but the Avengers intervened, and the Thunderbolts disbanded in the incident\u2019s aftermath. However, Vantage was offered a Homeland Security position by reserve Avenger Warbird.",
