Doubling as both bartender and bouncer, Zuzha would often use her skills to break up bar fights between college students and her local patrons.  It was after one of these barroom brawls that Zuzha was approached by Dr. Walter Langowksi, the Canadian hero known as Sasquatch, and offered membership in a new incarnation of Alpha Flight.  Although Zuzha initially refused the offer, she was compelled to join the fledgling team after losing a bet to Langkowski.  In exchange for her cooperation, Langkowski promised to tell Zuzha his theories as to how she received her superhuman powers.",
