He has low-level telepathy (stronger in Allen than the others) and is immune to certain forms of detection including Spider-Man's spider-sense. The Carrion virus is strangely non-communicable. Once it has a host, it becomes dormant and cannot be transmitted to others. Separated from a host body, however, it is extremely contagious. Despite the appearance of being \"undead\", the virus does not kill its host.",
