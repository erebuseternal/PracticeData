    "content": "After having millennia to contemplate the tactical errors made in their first Earth invasion, the Kronans staged another attempted invasion of the planet approximately 10 Earth years ago. Staging an attack from a secret base on Iapetus, a moon orbiting the nearby planet of Saturn, the Kronans landed a much larger invasion force in the nation of Norway on Earth\u2019s Scandinavian Peninsula. The brothers Korg and Margus, still inexperienced young bricks at the time, were among the Kronans assembled for the attack. Anxious to conquer, the invasion force pursued a native bystander, Dr. Donald Blake, into a nearby cave where he uncovered Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, one of Earth\u2019s various thunder gods. Meanwhile, the Kronans proceded to attack Earth\u2019s military forces, using their illusion-casting technology to scare them into retreat. Eventually Blake, who had been transformed into Thor by the Mjolnir\u2019s magic properties, confronted the Kronans and used his godly powers to defend against every attack the invaders initiated. Finally, the Kronans unleashed one of their Mechano-Monster units against the god, but Thor destroyed it with one swing of Mjolnir. Badly beaten and terrified at Thor\u2019s power levels, the Kronan invasion force once again fled to their starships and retreated, only to learn much later that not all Earth natives possessed Thor\u2019s godly powers.In their hasty retreat, one of the Kronan starships crashed on an asteroid and became separated from the rest of the fleet. When Thor and a group of his fellow Earth gods happened upon the asteroid, the Kronans attacked in an attempt to steal the starship of the gods. Unable to match the power of the gods, the Kronans salvaged the Gravitron from their disabled vessel and modified it into a weapon to counter Thor. But Thor once again prevailed over the Kronans, destroying the vessel and setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the entire asteroid.",
