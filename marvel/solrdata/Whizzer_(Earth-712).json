Stewart also joined several members of the team in publicly revealing their identities as a gesture of good faith.After several months of implementing the program, the Squadron was openly opposed by the Redeemers, a team dedicated to opposing the Squadron's \"Utopian\" rule. The battle was devastating, and the Squadron was convinced to dismantle the Utopia Program.Before the Squadron could fully dismantle their program, a white being of immense size began to grow and threaten to devour the Sun. Members of the Squadron, including the Whizzer, sought help from various avenues and boarded a space ship to battle their mysterious foe. The threat was thwarted thanks to Arcanna's newborn son, but when the team tried to return to Earth, they found themselves exiled to the Avengers' reality. Stewart stood by the other Squadron members during their time trapped on Earth.",
