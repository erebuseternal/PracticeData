    "content": "Learning the mutant-hunting Sentinels could store psionic energy, Onslaught abducted scientists to create a Sentinel army. Soon after, Xavier encountered X-Man (Nate Grey) on the astral plane, who pulled Xavier\u2019s astral form into the physical world. Onslaught thus escaped Xavier\u2019s mind, but was still \u201ctethered\u201d to Xavier. To assist disseminating his hyper-psionic energy, Onslaught had the mutant teleporter Gateway abduct the psionic mutant Chamber, sent the armored mutant Post to \u201ctest\u201d the X-Men and Cable, and recruited and empowered other mutants such as Blob, Mimic and Holocaust. Now fully possessing Xavier, Onslaught revealed Xavier\u2019s suppressed darker memories to Jean Grey, hoping to recruit her Phoenix Force experience to gain more power. Rejecting Onslaught, Jean removed the Juggernaut\u2019s mental block, discovering that Onslaught was Xavier. Onslaught then trapped Juggernaut\u2019s consciousness inside Marko\u2019s own empowering Ruby of Cyttorak, and created the child-like psionic projection Charlie to befriend and capture vastly powerful mutant child Franklin Richards.As Xavier, Onslaught attempted to lead the X-Men to war against humans. When the X-Men resisted, Onslaught revealed itself and attempted to destroy them. Onslaught then mentally enslaved the Hulk and sent him after Cable, but Cable and Storm freed the Hulk. Onslaught captured X-Man, adding both his and Franklin\u2019s psionic powers to its own. It sent the Sentinels to Manhattan to sow panic, created a Central Park citadel, and unleashed an electromagnetic pulse. The X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers and even Doctor Doom opposed Onslaught, and after Thor freed Xavier, Onslaught became even more powerful.",
