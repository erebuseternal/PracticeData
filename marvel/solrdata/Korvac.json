    "content": "The cosmic gamesman Grandmaster and the robot strategist Prime Mover transported Korvac to the modern era of the Earth-616 reality, where he served as one of the various pawns pitted against each others in a contest of champions. The Prime Mover\u2019s pawns including Korvac, fought the Gamemaster\u2019s pawns, the heroic Defenders, who ultimately triumphed. During the game, the Defenders leader Doctor Strange had bested Korvac, who later claimed he had allowed himself to be defeated so that he might secretly analyze and partially replicate the Grandmaster\u2019s cosmic knowledge and power. Having accomplished this, the newly enhanced Korvac returned to the 31st Century Earth-691 and adopted a desolate planetoid as his base, transforming it into a high-tech wonderland. He then used his time probe (a time-spanning teleportation device) to accumulate resources and servants, such as his alien underlings Brahl, Dumog, Grott, Teju and Tork (also known as the Minions of Menace). Korvac devised a plan to force Earth\u2019s sun to go nova in hopes of tapping its power, Korvac was opposed by his era\u2019s leading heroes, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the legendary thunder god Thor, whom Korvac had accidentally transported from the past. Defeated by Thor and the Guardians, Korvac fled.",
