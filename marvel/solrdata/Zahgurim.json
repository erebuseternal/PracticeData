To show his love for Zahgurim and to protect himself from sorcerers detecting his actions, the man removed the magic users' skin intestines, eyes, bones and other body part he could use and made his armor from the pieces; the magical radiation permeating their bodies protected him from magical assault. While completing his task Armorer took the life of Avram Siegel an occult expert and author of \"The Hierarchy of Hells: A Layman's guide to the Demonological Tree,\" using his flesh to strengthen his armor; though the death did not further his dowry. Although it did attract the attention of Siegel's friend Damion Hellstorm, who detected Zahgurim's scent over Siegel's remains. Hellstorm confronted Zahgurim and insisted that he stop his servant, but Zahgurim refused and escaped back to Hell.",
