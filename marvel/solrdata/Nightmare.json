Nightmare has worked to corrupt unstable super-beings such as the Hulk and Cloak, each of whom have gone on mad Nightmare-inspired rampages, but his influence usually proves temporary. For a time, Nightmare was allied with rival fear-sowing entities such as the Fear Lords, but the group was thwarted by Dr. Strange and his allies.",

He can trap psyches indefinitely but usually only torments souls temporarily lest he permanently deplete the psychic energies he consumes. While inside his own realm, Nightmare is virtually omnipotent; however, he is less powerful and more vulnerable when he manifests outside his kingdom, and was particularly diminished when he assumed mortal form as Edvard Haberdash.",
