For a while Kane blamed Cable for his pain. This blame was later redirected at Stryfe. After months of rehabilitation and work Cable reappeared to Kane and took him into the future again and joined Cable's fight against Apocalypse.Kane eventually returned to the present where he retired and decided to settle down with his girlfriend Vanessa. However Kane was later employed by A.I.M. who at the time had captured Guardian of Alpha Flight. Wolverine, seeking his former teammate severly beat Kane and other A.I.M. lackeys before finally freeing his friend.Kane then wandered America searching for ways to become stronger, faster, and better. The Director of the new Weapon X program learned of Kanes search and offered to make him more powerful than he ever dreamed. Kane agreed to the Directors proposal and underwent further bionic augmentation. To make sure that he was loyal the Director made Kane's first mission to kill his ex-girlfriend Copycat who had also joined the program and had her powers augmented. Kane agreed to perform the task and as he was about to kill Copycat, Deadpool managed to save her and planted a bomb on Kane. When the bomb detonated Kane was blown into tiny pieces. However Weapon X managed to reconfigure and reconstruct Kane perfectly.",

His arms were also capable of repairing themselves. \n\nDue to the enhancements that the newest incarnation of Weapon X has given him, Kane now has numerous bionic appendages which houses various weapons. He now has the ability to see in various spectrums of light, project holograms, and he has a computerized targeting system. His strength was also upgraded and he is now more resistant to damage. He could download super powers such as toxic emissions, metal control, and various other abilities. It has been shown that when Kane was blown up by Deadpool, Weapon X was able to reconstruct him perfectly. It is unknown if he can always be rebuilt or if it was just that one incident.",
