There he discovered the Hawk God in his inert statue form. It was in this place that Stakar merged with Aleta through Hawk God\u2019s power, and the two siblings became the composite being known as Starhawk. Stakar built a brain-wave helmet from components found in temple. He had hoped to obtain knowledge of ancients, Aleta converted to disembodied consciousness fused with Hawk God statue after she triggered helmet. Intoxicated by her new found abilities the power-mad Aleta wrecked an Arcturian military air fleet. Stakar realized Aleta needed his wisdom to control Hawk God's power, thus the two siblings were fused together by a nuclear explosion.",
