The two battled, but the In-Betweener ultimately lost when Doctor Strange alerted his masters to his scheme.Afterwards, the In-Betweener attempted to escape subservience to Lord Chaos and Master Order by allying himself with the Elders of the Universe with the plan to replace Galactus\u2019s role in the universe.  However, Galactus did not agree with this plan and defeated the In-Betweener in battle allowing him to be imprisoned by Chaos and Order.  Later, the mad titan Thanos freed him from his prison only to trick the In-Betweener into surrendering his soul gem to him.  Although free for a while, the In-Betweener was captured by his masters once again.",
