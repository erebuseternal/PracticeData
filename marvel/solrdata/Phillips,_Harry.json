But when she smelled the flowers he revealed that they were coated with a secret ingredient that would knock her unconscious. Though Susan acted quickly, and held her breath in time to avoid succumbing. She then turned invisible and tried to run away, but Phillips used his new super hearing to find her and he fired an Ether Gun after her, which soon knocked her out once she was forced to take a breath. Afterwards, Phillips dragged Sue\u2019s unconscious body to his master\u2019s hidden base.",
