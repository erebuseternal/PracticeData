    "content": "The Wraiths who killed Jones were a mystically-inclined faction, indifferent to technology and unaware of the Torpedo suit's significance, so they left it behind. With Jones dead and his immediate family either killed or in hiding, the Torpedo suit and some of Brock's other belongings were eventually packed up and sent to his cousin, Phillip Jeffries, who stored it in his attic and forgot about it. Years later, Phillip's son Mike had become a freshman engineering major at Long Island University, and was searching for a costume for a Halloween party at his school. A lifelong superhero fan and avid comic book reader, Mike assembled a generic superhero suit for himself from various odds and ends, but he had also promised to supply a costume for his best friend, journalism major Mickey Musashi. Finding the Torpedo armor in his family's trunk and mistaking it for a conventional Halloween costume, Mike gave the \"incredibly goofy-looking\" armor to Mickey, who wore it to the party that night. Meanwhile, a group of scientists who had worked in the lab that produced the Torpedo armor detected its reactivation; donning Rocketeer armor, they crashed the party in search of the Torpedo suit, attacking Mike and Mickey. Instinctively activating the armor's turbines, Mickey swiftly defeated the Rocketeers, calling herself \"Torpedo Sue\" after misinterpreting a Rocketeer's half-finished remark about the \"Torpedo suit\". Mike was amazed, and appalled that he had given away the sort of super-powers he had always dreamed of having.Unaware of the armor's origins, Mickey and Mike decided to keep it and took turns using it. Mickey was a natural, mastering the suit's basic functions with ease, but Mike's command of the suit's abilities was clumsy and far more limited. Despite this, Mike wanted to use the suit as a superhero. Mickey, however, was only interested in using the armor's high-speed flight capability for world travel, and she repeatedly visited Europe. During one of these transatlantic voyages, she stumbled upon armed smugglers in league with the super-criminals Cardinal and Sea Urchin. Mickey fled the scene after the smugglers shot at her, but she later felt shamed into investigating further when she saw news reports of the New Warriors, heroes as young as herself, clashing with the same smuggling ring. Calling herself Turbo, Mickey helped the New Warriors capture Sea Urchin, Cardinal and the rest of the smugglers. Later, an overenthusiastic Mike Jeffries also went into action under the alias Turbo, using the armor to aid the New Warriors and other heroes against the shadow-powered madman Darkling.Despite Mickey's reluctance to play superhero, she and Mike began training with the New Warriors so that they could use their suit better, and they helped their mentor Nova defeat the criminal Air Force team during one of these training sessions. The Turbo duo eventually became official Warriors after Mickey helped the group defeat the Sphinx, initially serving as reservists; however, Mike virtually never saw any action with the team, since the far more capable Mickey was invariably called in when the group needed Turbo. Mickey gradually became a full time member of the Warriors despite herself, but she eventually tired of her superhero life and resolved to retire as Turbo, figuring Mike would take over; however, after Dire Wraith queen Volx murdered Mike and usurped the armor, a fighting-mad Mickey helped the Warriors defeat Volx and reclaimed the armor, resolving to continue as Turbo in Mike's memory. Having gotten used to sharing the suit, Mickey offered to split custody of it with non-powered Warriors teammate Hindsight (an awkward superhero fan very much like Mike), but the Warriors drifted apart and broke up before anything came of that potential partnership.Rejoining the Warriors after they regrouped, Turbo drastically reconfigured her armor using designs Mike had drawn up before his death. She also began dating arson investigator Dalton Beck, unaware that Beck was secretly the criminal mercenary Firestrike and that crimelord Joe Silvermane had hired Beck to eliminate Turbo and steal her armor. Mickey fell deeply in love with Dalton, even sharing her secret identity with him, and Dalton found himself falling for her despite his original intentions. Though he had opportunities to kill Mickey and steal her armor, he could not bring himself to do it. When Mickey finally discovered the truth about Dalton, he helped the Warriors capture his former partners in the Heavy Mettle criminal mercenary squad, and he tried to win Mickey back. Unmoved even after Dalton saved her during the battle, Mickey rejected Dalton's apologies and turned him over to the authorities. She later reconsidered and told the imprisoned Dalton she was willing to give him a second chance, only to learn that he was entering the witness protection program and would never see her again. Heartbroken, Turbo almost started a rebound romance with teammate Nova, but it never quite clicked.",
