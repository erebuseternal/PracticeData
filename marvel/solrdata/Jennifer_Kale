The aged Dakimh took Jennifer as his apprentice, drawing energies from the angelic realm Therea and demonic realm Sominus to use the Tome to prevent Earth's invasion by the demon Thog. Jennifer joined Dakimh, the Man-Thing, Howard the Duck, and Korrek, warrior of extradimensional Katharta, in opposing further plots of Thog, the Congress of Realities, the wizard Klonus and barbarian Mortak, and the mad demon Bzzk'joh and his Imperium Emporium. Even after Dakimh's death, his spirit continued to advise her. Between efforts to live a normal life at various colleges, she has been drawn into numerous magical conflicts, including learning of her familial connection to both Johnny Blaze and Dan Ketch.",
