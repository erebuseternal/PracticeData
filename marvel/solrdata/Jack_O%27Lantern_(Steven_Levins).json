They fought for a while Falcon took care of Jack O'Lantern and Blackwing and Captain America took down Crossbones and Mother Night with the help of Diamondback. Jack O'Lantern and the other villains were imprisoned in the Vault.After he managed to escape from prison. He was seen in the auction of bodies of deceased superheroes held by Chess Set. The auction was interrupted when Alpha Flight and Spider-Man crashed the party and Levins quietly slip away in the confusion. He later fought a different Spider-Man, Spider-Man's clone Ben Reilly. He teamed with Beetle, Boomerang, Scorpia and Shocker to get the prize money offered for a skeleton wearing a Spider-Man outfit that Ben Reilly had found in a smokestack. Reilly managed to take them all out and decided to give the skeleton away to get them off his back.Some time later he was hired with Shocker and Constrictor by Dennis Golembuski a crimelord who mainly focused on diamond smuggling. They ran into a problem when young low-level criminal the Hood stole some of the diamonds and even managed to beat the trio. Golembuski wasn't pleased and sent Madam Rapier with them to retrieve the diamonds. She ordered them to stay back till she gave the signal, but things didn't go like she had planned. Trio saw this, but decided not to intervene. Hood outfitted her with a red hood and federal agents though that she was The Hood and shot her. Trio was quite surprised what had happened and even more surprised when Hood gave them the diamonds back. They took the diamonds back to devastated Golembuski fulfilling their contract with him. After this Levins has seen working with Constrictor and Armadillo fighting heroes like Spider-Man and Hercules, but with little success.He resurfaced just before the Stamford incident. He was hired by the  terrorist organization R.A.I.D. that had organized terrorist attacks on several targets in London. He, Jackhammer and Shockwave were ordered to flood the Thames Tunnel, but their plans were foiled by Union Jack's intervention. All the villains were arrested and Jack O'Lantern was most likely deported back to U.S.A.. He then was convicted and jailed until Songbird recruited him to a special branch of Thunderbolts. This branch has since been put into action in order to hunt down the heroes of the Anti-Registration resistance. It was while tracking down Spider-Man with the help of Jester that Jack O'Lantern was killed by the Punisher.",
