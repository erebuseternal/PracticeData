The process significantly increased her strength and durability to superhuman levels, but it was unrevealed if she was able to transform at will. She shared the Abomination's abilities to regenerate extensively damaged parts of her body, recover from almost any injury, and presumably had high resistance to extremes of temperature, and could hold her breath for extended periods of time. A side effect the process was the gamma infusion acted like a \"super-cancer,\" and when original flesh was destroyed tumor-like cells would replace it.",
