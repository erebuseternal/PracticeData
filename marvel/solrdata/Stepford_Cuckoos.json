The Cuckoos were placed into Cyclops' Corsairs squad, after which Mindee helped the blind X-Man Gambit defend the Institute from an attack by a reformed Brotherhood of Mutants. The Cuckoos then faced the return of Quire after a splintered Phoenix Force came to the Institute seeking Jean. Quire sought to resurrect his beloved Sophie and asked the Force for help. It restored her to life, but upon seeing Quire she chose to return to death. The Force departed after merging with Jean to search for its missing pieces, one of which later visited the Cuckoos. Recently, when the immovable mutant the Blob attacked the Institute, the Cuckoos were instrumental in his defeat by the students. During the mutant Scarlet Witch's reshaping of reality, the Cuckoos briefly became a quintet once more.",

Through their bond, the Cuckoos communicate almost instantaneously, often speaking in unison or finishing one another's sentences. The strength of this bond is based on proximity; the further away they are from one another, the weaker it becomes.",
