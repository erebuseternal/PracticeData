During this time Happy suffered his third and most monstrous transformation into the Freak, but was again depowered and told he was completely cured. The Hogans moved to Colorado, where they tried ranching, before settling in Cleveland, Ohio. Happy found work as a fight manager and he and Pepper became foster parents to a young boy and girl.Happy and Pepper faced financial difficulties and unemployment, and once again, the couple struggled with their relationship. Happy turned inward and began to drink excessively. Mistakenly believing Happy was cheating on her, Pepper had an affair with a high school friend, severely damaging the marriage. The two divorced.Happy experienced an awkward reunion with his ex-wife working under Tony's new business Stark Solution, where Pepper was also employed. Over time, Happy and Pepper were able to put their past behind them. They remarried and tried to start a family. The Hogans remained with Tony at Stark Industries following the failure of Stark Solutions. Pepper became pregnant, but was assaulted by Iron Man's armored enemy Ayisha and suffered a miscarriage. Pepper never told Happy about her pregnancy, and the absent communications resulted in a new strain on their relationship. Happy began drinking heavily again, and became angered when Tony accidentally revealed the pregnancy to him. Storming away from Tony, Happy was accidentally struck by snipers firing on Stark, but survived the attack.",
