She could fire bolts of energy, turn intangible at will, was capable of flight, able to transmit her powers over radio waves and could potentially, like Zzzax, control magnetic force. Needing to feed off bio-electrical sources from electrical impulses in living beings, she was able to generate a bio-electric force field as well as absorb the powers from another super being. Having had the same abilities as Zzzax, it could be presumed Axon was vulnerable to the same weaknesses such as attacks that absorb, ground, or control energy.",
