He used his magic to bond Brandy Clark to an empty Spaceknight armor and weaved a spell to force her to do his bidding. He could also instantly enthrall humans by shooting a spell that would wrap the victims in black tendrils and claws. By using his magic to cast a spell of teleportation he can travel around the world, and carry at least one other person with him. Dredd like most other Dire Wraiths can change his appearance by mentally altering his body structure into any organic form; generally humans and a red fanged serpent. Dredd possesses superhuman strength and durability, and he could also make himself so razor-sharp that he could not be touched by others; this also allowed him to cut his targets to shreds. Dredd\u2019s body produced a peculiar odor that made him detectable by the Spaceknights of Galador.",
