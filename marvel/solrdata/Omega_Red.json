Omega Red clashed with both Maverick and Wolverine, but was defeated by Wolverine\u2019s teammates in the mutant super-team the X-Men. Omega Red later fell under the psionic control of the mutant Soul Skinner who forced him to battle against Wolverine and the X-Men until the telepath\u2019s death.Omega Red then sought to kill the cyborg M.O.D.A.M., whom he believed was a former KGB operative that had betrayed him, but was opposed by the armored Avenger Iron Man. Omega Red subsequently clashed with the team of mutant trainees Generation X as well as the costumed crimefighter Daredevil and the Russian super-spy the Black Widow.",
