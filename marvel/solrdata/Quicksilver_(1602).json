            "content": "While his father prepared to burn a boy born with angel wings, Petros sped to the court of King James to encourage him to side with Enrique once he came to power. James agreed, and Petros promised him that Enrique would turn all of England against the witchbreed, but that the students of Carlos Javier must be brought to Enrique for punishment. Javier was a fellow witchbreed, and an ex-friend of Enrique\u2019s, who built a school to house the less physically appealing witchbreed, and so was set against Enrique. Petros also implied that Enrique could speed up Elizabeth\u2019s inevitable death, for which James was agreeable. Petros allayed James\u2019 questions about Petros\u2019 efficiency as a messenger, by ironically joking about running fast. But run fast he did, and he kept up the correspondence with James. When Count Otto von Doom killed Queen Elizabeth, James assumed Enrique had, and told Petros as much, though Petros declined to contradict him. James then agreed to turn over any witchbreed to Enrique. But once James had taken control of the English Crown and captured Javier\u2019s students, he baulked at Petros\u2019 suggestion that he owed them to Enrique, and Petros left before James could force Petros to work for him, instead. Petros next ran to Toad, Enrique\u2019s man in the Vatican, who told him that the Pope was less concerned about the Inquisition, and more concerned about Doom\u2019s rise in power.But Petros set to the roads again, and traveled to warn Doom of the approach of Javier's students, though Doom found out moments later. He then watched as Javier\u2019s students and Nicholas Fury, the Queen\u2019s spymaster, besieged Doom\u2019s Castle. He hurried back to report to his father that Doom\u2019s Castle had fallen and that James had arrived in England and begun to imprison Fury\u2019s cohorts, including the court\u2019s previous physician, Doctor Strange. Though Petros was actually reporting to one of the King\u2019s men, who had found out after threatening Toad of Enrique\u2019s true plans. The man captured Petros, along with his sister and father, and readied them to be burnt at the stake. But before they could be, Enrique had the man bring him a special helmet made for him by Javier, and used his own powers to pull off his own chains, along with his children\u2019s, and together they subdued the guards; then escaped England altogether.They set sail to rendezvous with the rest of Enrique\u2019s Brotherhood, as he began to call them, but the winds took them in a different direction, and Enrique decreed that they would go with them. The boat eventually took them to the New World, where Javier\u2019s men attacked them, freezing the boat and imprisoning Petros and his family within. Javier soon boarded the boat, himself, offering Petros\u2019 father freedom in exchange for help to heal their world that was slowly tearing itself apart after a stranger from a future time landed in the Roanoke Colony of America. His father agreed, and he joined the group of heroes who succeeded in repairing the rift and saving their universe.",
