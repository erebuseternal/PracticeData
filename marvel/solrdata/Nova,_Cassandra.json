    "content": "In Charles\u2019 body, Cassandra publicly outed him as a mutant. After the Beast discovered her secret, Cassandra telepathically coerced the young student Beak to bludgeon him into a coma, and then left Earth with the alien Shi\u2019ar. Cassandra mentally coerced the Shi\u2019ar Empress Lilandra into ordering the Imperial Guard to Earth to destroy all mutants under the premise they were infected with a mental plague. After the truth was revealed, the Imperial Guard joined with the X-Men in an attempt to stop Cassandra after she returned to Earth. As they all fell before her power, Jean Grey used the Cerebra computer to place a piece of Charles\u2019 consciousness into the mind of every living mutant on Earth. When Cassandra used Cerebra in an attempt to kill all mutants, Charles\u2019 consciousness was re-connected and he forced Cassandra out of his body. Now fleshless, the mummudrai desperately sought another body. Emma Frost presented it with what appeared to be its old body; however, it was a trap laid by Emma and her students, the Stepford Cuckoos, who forced the Imperial Guardsman Stuff to transform its alien bio-computer body into a synthetic copy of Cassandra\u2019s body. On entering the body, the mummudrai found itself trapped in a child-like state and forced to undertake pre-programmed tutelage.",
