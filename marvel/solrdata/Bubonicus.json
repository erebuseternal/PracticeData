His quest led him to many that had fallen victim to extinction by disease and plagues.  Upon seeing the pain and suffering that the inhabitants were subject too, Ripjak decided that it would be merciful to destroy the planets dying population than to allow them to continue to suffer. His actions of so called mercy were viewed as genocidal, which led him to be perused by the Galactic Guardians. After years of searching for the source of the plagues, he finally learned of the being known as Bubonicus the \u201cPlague Bringer.\u201d Bubonicus' powers were even effective against Eternity.",
