After renewing contact with Xavier, they discussed the possibility of establishing a school for training mutants. Moira became Xavier\u2019s silent partner in founding the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters and its\u2019 first team of mutant students, the X-Men.When Moira\u2019s son Kevin began to manifest destructive superhuman mutant powers, she attempted to \u201ccure\u201d him, but her efforts were in vain and she was forced to keep him imprisoned. Moira also came to take a young mutant Scottish girl named Rahne Sinclair as her ward, sending her to study at Xavier\u2019s as a member of the New Mutants.Moira finally met the X-Men while claiming to be their new housekeeper, but they soon learned her true profession. During her affiliation with the X-Men, Moira fell in love with Sean Cassidy. Meanwhile, Kevin escaped Muir Isle and began to possess the bodies of others, draining their life energies to power his ability to warp perceptions of reality. As Proteus, Kevin terrorized the town of Edinburgh and was confronted by the X-Men. Kevin attacked and possessed his father\u2019s body, killing him, before being killed himself by Colossus.",
