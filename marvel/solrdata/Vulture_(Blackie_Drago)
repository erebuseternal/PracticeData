Drago practiced his flying skills over Manhattan. Drago found that he was stronger than Toomes ever was and more inventive and thus designed a helmet with a short wave receiver. Blackie wasted no time starting a one-man crime wave adopting the mantle of the Vulture. The Vulture became the hot news topic in a matter of days.  His only goal was to make money by performing acts of air-piracy. Due to Spider-Man's cold and apparent weakness, Blackie attacked a helicopter and stole its shipment of uncut diamonds without difficulty. His infamy as New York's greatest villain attracted the attention of not only Spider-Man, but also one of Spider-Man's greatest enemies, Kraven the Hunter.In a major battle between Spider-Man, Kraven and the new Vulture, Kraven\u2019s double-barreled ray missed Spider-Man and accidentally collided with the Vulture knocking him unconscious. This gave Spider-Man a chance to tear the ray out of Kraven\u2019s vest and strike him with a heavy punch. Both villains lay defeated. Blackie was returned to prison. It was later revealed that the Toomes was alive and well.",
