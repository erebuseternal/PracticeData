The Dweller also manipulated a number of people into killing themselves in exchange for promises of eternal life, transforming them into Shade-Thralls, who nearly overwhelmed Thor and Hercules before the Dweller withdrew to avoid detection. While using other Shade-Thralls against Dr. Strange and Clea, the Dweller gained sufficient power to break Zhered-Na's spell. Still acting from the shadows, the Dweller empowered Barbara Robb as the reality-altering Dream Weaver, who sought to steal the Book of the Vishanti before Strange revealed the forces with which she was dealing and erased her memory and powers; then secretly aided the demons Ludi and Ningal against Strange. Though his agents met defeat, Strange was unable to determine who had sent them, and the Dweller claimed victory by introducing doubt and fear into the one being who could oppose him.",
