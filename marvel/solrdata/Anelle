The King knew that Morrat wanted his throne and would deceive him to try and overthrow him. So, together with Princess Anelle, they tracked down Morrat and found him fighting with the newly repowered Fantastic Four. Morrat tried to ingratiate himself by pretending he had brought them for the King, but the King was not fooled, and he stripped Morrat of his rank and ordered his men to kill him. Anelle tried to throw herself in front of their blazing laser rifles in order to save the man she loved, but the Invisible Girl put a force field around her, saving her. Morrat was not so lucky and was cut down by her father\u2019s troops.",
