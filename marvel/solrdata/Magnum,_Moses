Opposed by the visiting X-Men and national hero Sunfire, Magnum ultimately unleashed his power but was countered by Banshee, who burned out his own power to block Magnum\u2019s seismic energy. The resultant explosion destroyed Magnum\u2019s base, but Magnum survived. Re-establishing his company as Magnum Munitions, Magnum purchased the classified Deathlok cyborg technology from Cybertek. After the criminal High-Tech stole the technology, Magnum sent one of his agents in a massive \u201cTerrordome\u201d weapons platform to retrieve it, but was thwarted by Deathlok (Michael Collins). Magnum subsequently bid against rival weapons manufacturers A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) for a defense contract, destroying their world headquarters after they refused to withdraw their bid. Magnum used the subsequent profits to outfit a new army, conquering the African nation Canaan and seeking to restructure it into a homeland for African-Americans. Magnum then sought to ensure Canaan\u2019s economic independence by invading neighboring Wakanda, but Wakanda\u2019s king, the Black Panther (T'Challa), foiled the invasion with Deathlok\u2019s aid.",
