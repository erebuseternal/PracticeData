The Frost Giants origin is lost in antiquity; however, they are known to predate the gods of Asgard themselves.  Few in number due to the heavy losses sustained over the millennia in battle with the gods, the Frost Giants dwell in the frozen land of Niffleheim north of the country of Asgard proper.  Their huge size, durability, and raw power make them the gods most formidable foes.Age has not diminished Ymir's power in the least.  Although possessing some intelligence and capable of speech, Ymir is not particularly cunning or subtly motivated.  His vast physical power has enabled him to survive and maintain his rule over his kinsmen over the millennia.",
