There the Hulk met a race of green skinned people, ruled by the beautiful Jarella, with Bruce Banner\u2019s brain controlling the Hulk\u2019s body thanks to Jarella\u2019s Pantheon of Sorcerers. After Bruce Banner protected Jarella\u2019s realm from a usurper, she agreed to marry him; but Psyklop located his prey, shrank down, captured and returned the Hulk to Earth. Although without the sorcerers spell to give Banner\u2019s personality reign over the Hulk\u2019s mind, Psyklop was brutally attacked by the behemoth, destroying Psyklop\u2019s lab. The Dark Gods seized Psyklop and, as punishment for his failure, he was banished to K\u2019ai, where he spent months crafting a castle out of a mountain peak, rebuilding his machines and creating a robot to pose as the God of the Mountain, frightening off Jarella\u2019s people insuring his privacy.",
