Herod announced that Captain America would be the new President, but that he was only needed as a puppet leader.  At first, Captain America disagreed with the notion and the lack of democracy it represented, but after being electrocuted by Herod, along with a promise that there would be killing to be done, he agreed.  He then began his reign as President, appearing as a shining beacon of illusionary democracy on the television screens, but behind the cameras he suffered with the abuses and injuries Herod caused him, questioning his place in the new America.",
