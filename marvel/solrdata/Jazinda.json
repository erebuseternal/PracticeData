Having no way to know that Jazinda was only impersonating Jennifer Walters, he attempted to kill her for payback, for all the misery she had caused his wife, Titania. Jazinda quickly healed from her injuries and took Hi-Lite into custody before joining the real She-Hulk in the fight against The Absorbing Man and Titania.She later received an angry message from her father, Kl'rt the Super-Skrull. He called Jazinda a traitor to her race, and swore that if they would ever meet each other again, he would kill her. During the Skrulls' Secret Invasion, Super-Skrull traveled to Earth to fulfill his promise to his daughter, only to find her locked in battle with the Talisman known as Sacrosant. She-Hulk intervened, and battled the Super-Skrull. Jazinda's tussle with the Talisman ended with them smashing the ship's console, which sent them plummeting to the Earth. Jazinda survived the crash, but the resolution of the battle came when the Super-Skrull departed with the Talisman instead of fulfilling his promise to kill his daughter.",
