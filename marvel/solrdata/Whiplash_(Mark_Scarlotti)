This time he was an operative for Justin Hammer, another rival of Tony Stark. Hammer called on Scarlotti for various reasons even if he had to turn him against another Hammer employee. One such situation happened when the Scorpion double-crossed Hammer. The Scorpion received upgraded weaponry in exchange for abducting an army General. Scorpion changed his mind and wanted to trade the General for one of his enemies, J. Jonah Jameson instead of delivering the package to his employer. Justin Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino after his rogue agent which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man. In the end, Rhino and Blacklash fulfilled their mission by retrieving the upgraded costume leaving the Scorpion and Spider-Man behind.",
