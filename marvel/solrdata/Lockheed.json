During a battle with the despotic Doctor Doom, Lockheed was severely wounded while protecting Kitty. After undergoing surgery, his astral form was transported aboard the spaceship that carried the collective transient souls of his entire space-faring race. There, Lockheed was placed on trial for abandoning not only his people, but his intended bride on their wedding day. Lockheed defended his decision to leave, but during his speech the ship\u2019s pilots fell asleep. Lockheed was able to regain control of the ship, preventing his people\u2019s souls from dissipating. The court still found him guilty; however, they commuted the death sentence and instead exiled him from the Flock.",
