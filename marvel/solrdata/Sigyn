The All Father's actions enraged Sigyn, who secretly followed him as he traveled to Earth, and transported the real body of Donald Blake deep in the caverns of Mount Wundagore. In an attempt to steal Blake and use his as leverage to have Loki released. However, she accidentally destroyed Blake in the process of trying to free him from the spell created by Odin. She quickly covered her tracks by creating a doppelganger of the mortal. She revealed her action to Thor, who along with Riger of the Godpack discovered what was thought to be Loki's wedding band in a cave of Mount Wundagore.  Sigyn also told Thor that she used her magic to create a mystical armor to house Loki's spiritual remains, after his corporeal body was destroyed in the incident that led him to be a captive of the demon lord,  Mephisto.",
