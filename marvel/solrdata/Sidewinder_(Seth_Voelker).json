With his economical knowledge, Sidewinder's team of mercenaries proved to be one of the most formidable organization in the country.  However, Viper invaded the group and turned several members against Sidewinder, promising even larger amounts of profit.  Sidewinder abandoned the group, and turned leadership over to Cobra, who later took the name King Cobra.  Stressed from the life of a criminal, Sidewinder decided to leave the industry, but not without first saving Diamondback from the Serpent Society's death sentence.",
