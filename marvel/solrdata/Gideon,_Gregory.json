He instructed them to set it off when the FF entered the building. But his son, Thomas, heard his plan, and because he loved the Fantastic Four, he ran to stop the plot. Both Gideon and his wife tried to stop their son but he ignored them. Gideon ignored both his son and his wife in turn, obsessed with the idea of making more money and having more power.",
