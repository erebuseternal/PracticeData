Galactus sent Stardust to join two other former heralds, Firelord and Red Shift, in opposing the forces of Annihilus before taking the Silver Surfer as his herald once more. While in battle with Anihilus's forces on the planet Daedalus 5, Stardust and Red Shift detected the presence of Galactus, who had been turned into a weapon by Thanos. Stardust saved Gamora during her battle with another former herald, Terrax, and reunited her with the rest of the rebellion. In order to give Nova and his remaining forces time to evacuate, Stardust and Red Shift seemingly sacrificed themselves by delaying the destruction of Daedalus 5 by temporarily holding back the cosmic energies of Galactus before they could consume the planet.",
