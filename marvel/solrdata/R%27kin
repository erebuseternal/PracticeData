            "content": "R\u2019kin\u2019s time to prove himself as a warrior came when he rescued his idol, Kl\u2019rt the Super Skrull, during a firefight with Baroness S\u2019bak\u2019s forces. The Super Skrull was outnumbered by Skrull warbirds, but was still putting up a fight. R\u2019Kin, piloting one of the ships, swooped in and plucked the Super Skrull from the field of battle and became a fugitive as well. He explained to his idol that his father, General N\u2019ala, served and died under his command. R\u2019kin accompanied his new leader to the home of his most hated enemies, the Fantastic Four, and took a trip to the Negative Zone with the help of Mister Fantastic in hopes to find some way to destroy the forces of Annihilus. Soon, R\u2019kin\u2019s idolization of Super Skrull came to an end during a mission to \"interrogate\" some of Annihulus\u2019 troops. R\u2019kin was supposed to guard the room Super Skrull was questioning the prisoners in, but R\u2019kin wanted to help. He disobeyed orders and entered without permission. Inside, he watched as the Super Skrull ruthlessly tortured and killed his enemies. Super Skrull said it was a necessity, but R\u2019kin regarded it, and him, as evil.In the Negative Zone, Super Skrull squeezed a name from one of the Annihilation Wave troops of the individual responsible for creating their ultimate weapon called the Harvester of Sorrows. Hawal was the scientific genius that would soon be responsible for destroying the Skrull world of Zaragz\u2019na and take the life of the Kl\u2019rt\u2019s son. In his pursuit of Hawal, Super Skrull managed to raise an army comprised of other prisoners that Hawal tortured for his enjoyment. R\u2019kin joined the ranks of that militia with others like Praxagora and Preak. Hawal, with some extreme convincing, created a way to defeat the Harvester of Sorrows just as R\u2019kin was building a dimensional portal to liberate the Super Skrull\u2019s army from the Negative Zone. Once the portal was completed and Kl\u2019rt\u2019s forces were ready to strike, R\u2019kin convinced Super Skrull to allow the lowly mechanic to prove himself worthy of the Skrull name and deliver the killing blow to Annihilus\u2019 ultimate weapon of destruction. However, R\u2019kin only proved how treacherous the Skrull race can be when he betrayed the Super Skrull and did not show up to save Zaragz\u2019na from being obliterated.",
