The depowered students and staff were sent back to their homes; however, their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend William Stryker.  Kincaid's former teammate and friend Tag was among those killed. All of the remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were assigned to become a group of trainee X-Men. Kincaid was among those students who made the grade.After the death of Icarus, the New X-Men thought it would be best to destroy Nimrod once and for all. During the battle, X-23 was forced to cut a piece of Kincaid's hand to separate her from Nimrod, but she regenerated it. The team successfully defeated the robot through their group effort and Nimrod was sent back in time.",
