At the time the toxin was administered, Hulk's power levels were greatly increased due to his increased rage over his wife, Caiera's, death, and Hulk recovered quicker than expected. The Corps were defeated, their base in the Staten Island dump was destroyed and Ryker was arrested by SHIELD. Prodigy stayed with the Corps, and became a wanted fugitive, hunted by the US government.",
