In 12th century Asia, Lilith was trapped in a bottle by a midwife. A century later, Joseph della Reina thought to summon the Messiah by confronting Lilith and her latest demon consort, Ashmodei; no match for Lilith, Reina was transformed into a dog. In the 18th century, Lilith was challenged by Rabbi Elimelekh, who escaped unscathed. Some of her activities were perhaps in spirit form, for at some point Atlantean mages trapped her within a monstrous Leviathan (possibly Tiamat). Tales of her independence made her a heroine to some, with little idea of her history.",
