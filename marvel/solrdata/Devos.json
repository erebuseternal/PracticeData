As time progressed he learned to control his anger and rage, thus becoming a galactic vigilante. He would later be known as an extreme force for peace. In his quest for peace he has battled the Kree, Skrulls, and the inhabitants of Earth. He has also battled the mutated Fantastic Four of Earth.Devos joined a group of super villains known as the Fearsome Foursome. The members consisted of Huntara, Klaw and Paibok the Power-Skrull.
