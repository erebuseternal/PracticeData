As a result their friendship suffered as a result. After the death of Queen Elizabeth the First, King James of Scotland took over as King of England. He ordered Sir Nicholas Fury to capture all the witchbreed at  Carlos Javier\u2019s school. Fury ordered Peter Parquagh to warn Javier and his students to simply surrender. That way he could spare each of their lives. His students opposed the idea but Javier managed to make them see that this was their best option. At dawn Fury arrived at the school with an army waiting and took Javier and his students prisoner. That evening in the Tower of London, Javier, Fury and Stephen Strange discussed a way to rescue the Fantastick Four from the clutches of Count Otto von Doom of Latveria. Javier agreed to help and Fury managed to help them escape aboard the ship, The Eagle\u2019s Shadow. John Grey, with the help of Javier, managed to psychically steer the ship overland.",
