The Trolls agreed to his terms and set about making the hair, secretly preparing it in the event that Loki tried to renege on his side of the bargain.  Loki indeed stole the hair without paying for it, and presented it to Sif. Placed on her head, the gold hair began to grow as if it were natural, shinier than before. However, because the Trolls did not have a chance to treat it with a special potion before Loki stole it, the hair began to darken, finally becoming ebony black.When Sif began to cry once more, her parents began to tire of her vanity and so sent her off to learn the arts of warfare as a Shield Maiden. When she returned to Asgard years later, accomplished in the ways of the warrior, she had grown to accept her black tresses. Odin, lord of Asgard, had long deemed Sif to be a fitting mate for his son Thor, heir to the throne. Thor and Sif had seen little of one another in the millennia since their childhood when Odin deemed it time for them to renew their acquaintance. Thor had just been involved in a relatively brief relationship with a mortal Jane Foster, and Odin was anxious to make him forget it. Soon after meeting Sif again, Thor's interest in her turned to passion, and the two became lovers and companions.Eventually , they pledged to marry.  however, Thor's attachment for Earth frequently came between them.  Sif much preferred the world of the gods to the mundane world of mortals, and after attempting to adjust to Earth life on more than one occasion, returned to Asgard to live without Thor. Although Thor and Sif have not broken their betrothal, their marriage has been postponed until such time as they can reconcile their differences.",

Sif's Asgardian metabolism gives her far greater than human endurance during all physical activities. Sif has extensive training in unarmed combat as well as swordsmanship. Her natural fighting ability is only surpassed among Asgardian women by Brunnhilda the Valkyrie.",
