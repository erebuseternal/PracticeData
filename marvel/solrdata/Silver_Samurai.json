Later, Harada worked with Wolverine to free American private investigator Jessica Drew from the influence of Black Blade of Muramasa, a sword mystically imbued with its creator\u2019s madness. Wolverine himself fell under the sword\u2019s spell, but managed to overcome his possession after which Harada took up the sword, finding himself worthy of its power.After Mariko\u2019s death, Harada claimed leadership of Clan Yashida and was briefly employed by the Japanese government as leader of their fledgling super-team Big Hero 6. Ultimately, his inability to lead Clan Yashida allowed the Mongolian crimelord Haan Kaishek to take control, and he allied with Wolverine to defeat the Kaishek\u2019s. However, the disgrace of losing leadership was too great for Harada, and he returned to his mercenary ways.",
