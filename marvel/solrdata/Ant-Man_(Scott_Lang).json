    "content": "When his daughter was diagnosed with a fatal heart condition, Lang sought help from Dr. Erica Sondheim, who was kidnapped by Cross Technological Enterprises founder Darren Cross, for help with his own heart condition. In order to rescue her, and save his daughter, Lang broke in to the home of Dr. Henry Pym, the first Ant-Man, and stole his technology. After a successful rescue, Lang tried to turn himself in, but Pym allowed him to keep the suit, but for the purpose of good.Dividing his time between costumed heroics and his family responsibilities, Ant-Man worked alongside several super heroes, aiding members of the Avengers against the mercenary Taskmaster on two occasions. When Baron Zemo\u2019s Masters of Evil attacked the Avengers and took control of the Avengers Mansion, Ant-Man offered his assistance to the Avengers in defeating the criminal super-team. The Fantastic Four subsequently hired him as an electronics expert when Mister Fantastic was believed to be dead, and he was inducted into the team.Following Mister Fantastic\u2019s return, Ant-Man joined the team known as Heroes for Hire and clashed with such enemies as Ghaur and the Master. After Heroes For Hire disbanded, he again aided the Avengers against the Taskmaster; he also began dating former super hero Jessica Jones, although their relationship ended after he learned she was pregnant with Luke Cage\u2019s child. Ant-Man next fought alongside the Avengers against the menace of Scorpio and the In-Betweener, then was invited to join full-time, a role he only accepted after losing custody of his daughter to his ex-wife.",
