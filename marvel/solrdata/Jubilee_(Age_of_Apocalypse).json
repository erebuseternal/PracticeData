After Gambit successfully received a shard of the crystal, Lila transported the rest of the team back to Earth, sadly without Sunspot who sacrificed his life for the team. As they returned, Gambit split the team into two separate groups in order to escape from Rictor and try and give the crystal shard to Magneto. Jubilee went with Guido but unbeknownst to the team, Guido was actually a secret operative working for Apocalypse. After taking Magneto's son and the crystal shard, Jubilee tried to escape from Guido but was unfortunately captured by the traitor and forced to hand over the crystal shard and Magneto's son.",
