    "content": "His powers quiescent for years, Franklin enjoyed a more normal childhood. A resilient child, the powerless Franklin adapted to his parents\u2019 chaotic lives, once holding off the mercenary Deadpool with his own gun; however his powers reemerged when Franklin\u2019s nanny Agatha Harkness and the Fantastic Four were taken captive by Nicholas Scratch and Salem\u2019s Seven. Franklin\u2019s unconscious mind was strong enough to free Agatha, the entire population of New Salem, and his family from Scratch\u2019s control. Scratch possessed Franklin, using his powers against the Fantastic Four, but the team freed him with Agatha\u2019s help. Developing conscious control over his powers, Franklin wielded them against the alien Brain Parasites which controlled his mother. Reed resumed testing Franklin\u2019s powers until one test resulted in Franklin\u2019s unconscious mind creating Ego-Spawn, a superhuman manifestation of Franklin\u2019s insecurities. Reed took more covert actions after that, creating HUBERT (Hyper-Ultronic Brain Employing Randomized Tracings), a robotic baby-sitter for Franklin which monitored him for superhuman activity. Franklin soon lost control of his powers, transforming into an amnesiac, virtually omnipotent adult dubbed Avatar. When his mother realized who he truly was, Franklin restored himself to childhood, placing psychic dampers in his own brain to limit his own access to his powers. Simultaneously, he restored Ben to his rocky Thing state he\u2019d temporarily lost. (The realization that Ben subconsciously wanted to be the Thing stopped Franklin from actually curing him). Losing his powers again gave Franklin as normal a childhood as possible in a life where he could be whisked off across galaxies without notice, as happened when Franklin and the Thing saved the K\u2019rithian race from an alien Gh\u2019runji Gobbler, or where his bedroom could be unexpectedly invaded by miniature Micronauts.During this period, Franklin\u2019s powers again emerged, in a more controlled form: Franklin began precognitive dreaming, and could form a non-physical dream-self which could see, hear, and speak in the real world. One of his earlier dreams was of the young super-hero family known as Power Pack being attacked by aliens. While out with Jarvis, he met the Power Pack children and warned them, leading them to their Kymellian ally Kofi. The six were attacked by the Snark Jakal, an enemy of Power Pack, and it was Franklin who created the strategy to defeat him. Power Pack gave Franklin friends nearer his own age, and he enjoyed visiting a \u201creal family\u201d where he could watch movies, eat popcorn, and actually fight as he \u201cnever got to argue before\u201d. The newly confident Franklin decided that he now wanted to be called \u201cFrank\u201d, and Katie Power gave him a super-hero name: Tattletale. With the FF off in space again, Frank spent Thanksgiving with the Power children, Cloak and Dagger, Beta Ray Bill, and the X-Men\u2019s Wolverine and Kitty Pryde, also meeting future friend Leech (and Leech\u2019s guardian Annalee) there. Tattkletale\u2019s powers soon helped Power Pack save Leech and Caliban\u2019s lives during the \u201cMutant Massacre\u201d.When the Snark again attacked Power Pack, Frank pursued them in the Pack\u2019s Smartship Friday. Tattletale\u2019s dream-self enabled Friday to rescue Kofi, after which the trio rescued Power Pack and saved the Snark emperor from Jakal and his mother Maraud. The Fantastic Four headed for the Snark\u2019s world to find their missing son. In the FF\u2019s absence, Power Pack and Tattletale returned home and stayed with the Power family, while Kofi located the FF and explained that Frank had been returned. Frank and his parents were reunited in the Power\u2019s living room, which helped forge a friendship between the two families, enabling Frank to spend more time with his friends. Frank was attacked during this period by the rogue Sentinel Master Mold, which believed that Franklin was \u201cthe Twelfth\u201d (\u201cUltiman\u201d), one of twelve mutants instrumental in humanity\u2019s future. This information was later claimed to be false by the mutant Apocalypse, but in any case Tattletale and Power Pack temporarily destroyed Master Mold. Unfortunately for Frank (now calling himself Franklin again), the Richardses left the Fantastic Four and moved to Stamford, Connecticut in an attempt to provide a safe life. While leaving, they were attacked by Dr. Doom, who kidnapped Franklin to use his powers to free Doom\u2019s dead mother\u2019s soul from Mephisto. Doom won Franklin\u2019s trust but betrayed him to Mephisto, who jumped at the chance for vengeance. Reed followed Franklin into Hell and released Franklin\u2019s psychic dampers, forcing Mephisto to return them both. Franklin nearly condemned Doom to Mephisto\u2019s realm in retaliation before Reed stopped him.Franklin joined the Powers on a three-week Maine vacation, there bonding telepathically with a school of dolphins, and then left the planet with the Power children to visit New Kymellia (where the Pack fought and defeated the Kymellian warriors Force Four). The Pack met the cosmic being Numinus, who helped save the Kymellians when their artificial world was destroyed by the Snark Maraud. After the Richards family moved back to New York City, they allowed Franklin to stay with the Powers, and he attended public school beside them, again as Franklin Benjamin. When the world was threatened by the Star Stalker and a possessed Nova (Frankie Raye), Power Pack helped Franklin seek Galactus and retrieve an Elemental Obliterator. Aware that employing the device would kill him, Franklin still attempted to use it against the entity possessing Nova, but a member of the Elan race intervened. Tattletale\u2019s time with Power Pack ended when the Powers went into space seeking help for their son Alex; though they did return, the Powers moved to Washington state, ending Franklin\u2019s association with them.In an alternate \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d reality (Earth-811), a maturing Franklin attended Xavier\u2019s Academy, joined the New Mutants, and romanced Rachel Summers before being slain by Sentinels. As this future Franklin died, he sent a dream-self back in time to Earth-616 (mainstream Earth), tapping he younger Franklin\u2019 powers and altering reality. When this \u201ctapping\u201d began to harm young Franklin, the dream-self voluntarily discorporated, agan unlocking Franklin\u2019s potential. Franklin\u2019s grandfather Nathaniel Richards returned as Franklin\u2019s powers began manifesting anew. Claiming Franklin\u2019s presence was a threat to the timeline, Nathaniel stole Franklin away to the future, where he trained in the other-dimensional world of Elsewhen for years beside his aunt Huntara under the Warlord Kargul. Nathaniel returned Franklin to a point in time moments after he was taken, as the now-adult Psi-Lord.As Psi-Lord, Franklin aided his family against several threats and was briefly possessed by the malevolent psychic entity Malice before using Malice to destroy the other-dimensional Dark Raider. When his father was apparently killed and the Fantastic Four briefly dissolved, Franklin formed his own team, the Fantastic Force. Consisting of Psi-Lord, Huntara, Vibraxas, and Devlor, the team also briefly included Lyja, She-Hulk, and the Human Torch. They opposed a number of threats, including Klaw, Dreadface, Go-Devil, and Diablo. During this time, Franklin\u2019s powers changed again and he briefly projected three dream-selves (Avatar, Ego-Spawn, and Tattletale), while still maintaining his Psi-Lord abilities; the three dissipated when Psi-Lord released his full-force powers against Vaanguard. Fntastic Force disbanded soon after the discovery of the living Reed Richards.Hyperstorm (the child of Franklin and Rachel Summers in another divergent future, Earth-967) destroyed Psi-Lord to ensure his own existence, time traveling back and transporting the child Franklin from the moment when Nathaniel Richards kidnapped him to the present day. Psi-Lord no longer existed, and the child Franklin was restored. While the Four fought Hyperstorm, Franklin faced the evil psychic entity Onslaught, who disguised himself as a young child named Charlie, befriended Franklin, and absorbed Franklin Richards and the powerful mutant X-Man (Nate Grey) into himself. While X-Man and Franklin escaped from within, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and several others sacrificed their lives to stop Onslaught from without. Franklin emerged alive to find his family seemingly dead. In the aftermath, Franklin was given into his grandfather\u2019s custody.After a ceremony honouring the fallen (where he gifted Four Freedoms Plaza to the Thunderbolts, who later destroyed it), Franklin attended Emma Frost\u2019s Massachusetts Academy branch of Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters. He studied with children his own age, including Artie Maddicks and his old acquaintance Leech. When the Academy was attacked, Franklin unconsciously rescued himself by creating a dimensional gate. This act transported the Man-Thing there, and Franklin, along with Man-Thing, Leech, Artie, Tana Nile (an alien Rigellian who\u2019d been recuperating there) and Howard the Duck (who\u2019s chosen the wrong time to visit), became lost in a succession of child-like memories, chased by the shadowy being known as the Dark Hunter. It became apparent over the course of their travels that Franklin\u2019s powers were creating friendlier realities for them, including given the Man-Thing the power of speech. The Dark Hunter was revealed to be a manifestation of the pain and fear Franklin couldn\u2019t accept, and Franklin ultimately merged with the Dark Hunter, accepting the loss of his parents.Reunited with his family, Franklin moved into Pier Four, the FF\u2019s new waterfront headquarters. Franklin got a pet,a dog-like creature named Puppy who seemed a younger, smaller twin to the Inhumans\u2019 Lockjaw, and a new caretaker, the dimensionally displaced Caledonia. Franklin also acquired a sister when the time-dancing  Valeria von Doom (claimed daughter of Susan Richards) joined the family. Franklin\u2019s time at Pier Four proved brief; when catastrophe loomed, Reed and Sue sent Franklin, Puppy, and Caledonia to Haven, a school located on the far side of the universe, where they were soon joined by Valeria. When Franklin dreamed of Valeria\u2019s death at the hand of the cosmic force Abraxas, he and Valeria retuned to Earth. When Abraxas did appear, Valeria and Franklin combined their powers to ressurect the only being capable of stopping Abraxas: Galactus.",

    "powers": "Franklin Richards is a mutant with vast psionic powers. His abilities are so great that he can create \"pocket\" universes in alternate realities. (A \"pocket\" universe is a cosmos that does not equal our own in size.) When Franklin achieves the conscious use of his full powers, he will have telepathic powers, tremendous telekinetic powers, the ability to fire enormously powerful energy blasts, and the ability to rearrange the molecular structure of matter, even up to a cosmic scale.\nFranklin Richards has imposed mental blocks within his own mind to prevent him from using most of his psionic potential while he is still such a young child. It is possible that the strength of these blocks has faded over time, or that they cannot prevent him from utilizing his full powers unconsciously, as he did in creating the alternate reality to which he dispatched his parents and others following their clash with Onslaught. The mental blocks also work only when Franklin is in his physical body; his astral form can apparently use all of his psionic potential if it has separated from his physical form.\nThe mental blocks did not restrict Franklin from using his precognitive abilities, which manifest themselves in his dreams, enabling him to envision possible future events. Although there are countless possible futures, Franklin foresees the most probable future path, and therefore his predictions usually come true. Franklin seemingly cannot foresee events more than roughly a few days in the future. Franklin's precognitive power developed to the point at which he could see images of future events even when he's conscious.\nFranklin also developed the ability to place himself in a trance-like state while remaining fully conscious. While he is in this trance, he can project an intangible, ghostlike image of himself to another location, through which he can see and hear what goes on at that location. What Franklin has called the \"dreams\" he has while in this state are not truly dreams, but his conscious awareness of the environment into which he has projected his \"dream-self.\" It is not yet known how far Franklin can project his \"dream-self\" away from his physical body, but he has projected it onto a planet while his physical body was in a starship high above the planet's surface.\n\nFranklin has not recently manifested his powers to perceive the future or to project a \"dream-self\" and it is not clear whether he can still use these abilities or whether they have returned to latency.",
