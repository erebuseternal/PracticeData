Jean Grey had summoned Sunfire, but instead Sunpyre appeared, as Shiro was at the time unavailable. Sunpyre impressively battled Magneto, but almost was defeated when he created a metallic cocoon around her. Later, Sunpyre chose to return home instead of remain in the United States with the arrogant X-Men.Banshee later invited her to join his X-Corps. She spent most of her time in the laboratory studying the mutant, Abyss. However, Mystique had infiltrated the group and began her plan for taking over the X-Corps. Mystique stabbed Sunpyre to death, and also stabbed Banshee.",

Sunpyre can recharge and enhance her stored power by absorbing both solar and electromagnetic energy. She can also view her surroundings in the infrared spectrum. Sunpyre can create super-heated air currents which enable her to fly while leaving a trail of flame behind her. Sunpyre also generates an invisible field of psionic energy which protects her from the heat and radiation generated by her own powers, as well as from outside sources. The field also shields her from air friction and the light generated by her plasma, as well as lending a certain level of protection from kinetic impact.",
