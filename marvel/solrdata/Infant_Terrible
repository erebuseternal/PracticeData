But the infant only wanted to have fun, and soon turned the money from the truck and the diamond into pigs, mud, and a hatching bird. Big Joe got upset, but the Fantastic Four, minus Mister Fantastic, showed up and stopped the gang, imprisoning Big Joe in a set of tires for the police to pick him up. The infant ran during the struggle and when confronted it sent a rock monster after the three team members. The Human Torch and the Thing quickly took care of the monster, but the infant panicked again and encased the three in a pliable, fireproof bubble and traveled back to New York in the blink of an eye.",
