    "content": "Harry returned home, in a fragile state, with Mary Jane's presence a burden on his heart. Norman once again became the Green Goblin, and killed Gwen Stacy. Witnessing his father's apparent death battling Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of madness. While no one was watching, he removed his father's mask and costume before the police discovered the body. Harry held Spider-Man responsible for his father's death. Sometime later, Harry discovered his roommate's costume and secret identity. Insane and full of hate, he donned his father's costume and attacked Spider-Man as the new Green Goblin. With no superhuman powers, he was quickly defeated. Spider-Man removed the Goblin costume and paraphernalia from Harry before Harry was taken into custody. The police did not believe Harry's ravings that he was the Green Goblin since he looked too young. They therefore also did not believe Harry's claims that Peter was Spider-Man.Harry was sent into psychiatric care under Dr. Barton Hamilton. Hamilton successfully cured Harry of his insanity, and induced him into forgetting about his life as the Goblin, and hence his knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Harry returned home, and was reunited with his friends. He met Liz Allan, Peter's friend from Midtown High. The two began dating. Liz left for a short time, ashamed that Harry would not want to be with her after she was caught stealing for the sake of her step-brother, the Molten Man. Harry, however, accepted her when she returned to him.Soon afterwards, Harry became the successor to his father and president of Osborn Industries. He eloped with Liz Allan, and moved first to Long Island and then to a large house in Englewood, New Jersey, seeking a peaceful life. Harry and Peter drifted apart during this time, but were reunited by the return of the Molten Man and rise of the Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) threatening the Osborn family with demands for his father's strength enhancing serum. After a difficult labor brought on by the trauma of facing the Hobgoblin, Liz gave birth to a son, Norman Harold Osborn, and asked Peter and Mary Jane to be the godparents. When the Parkers were evicted from their apartment, Harry and Liz took them in as tenants.Before his death, however, Harry had planted a trap for Spider-Man whereby he funded the Chameleon to create life-models of Peter's parents. These replicas were so realistic, that they fooled Peter and his Aunt May. Spider-Man was emotionally devastated to discover the truth and Harry's involvement, and the replicas were destroyed. Sometime later, Spider-Man discovered within an abandoned Goblin warehouse a device which projected Harry's recorded memories into Peter's mind. Peter saw in his mind himself playing the roles of young Norman Osborn facing an abusive father as Harry had envisioned it, as well as recollections from Harry's youth. According to these recorded memories, unbeknownst to Norman, Harry had sabotaged the original Goblin formula, bitter at his father for consistently choosing work as a priority over his son.Ex-Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich chronicled the history of the Green Goblin in his book \"Legacy of Evil\" which Norman Osborn discredited. However, with Norman's identity publicly revealed, Urich's credibility has been restored.In the aftermath of Spider-Man accepting an offer from Mephisto to save the life of his Aunt May in exchange for the elimination of his marriage from the timeline of history, Harry has somehow returned to life. Divorced from Liz and two others, he has returned from a years-long stay in a European rehab. He has no memory of being the Green Goblin, nor of Peter Parker's alter-ego. Harry is now the owner of a chain of cafes based on his old college hangout, the \"Coffee Bean\" and, while he considers Peter his best friend, he hates Spider-Man with a vengeance. He is currently dating Lily Hollister, friend of NYPD's forensic specialist Carlie Cooper and daughter of New York, District Attorney, Bill Hollister.",
