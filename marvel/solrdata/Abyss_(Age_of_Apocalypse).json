He kidnapped a young boy and used him to draw Quicksilver into the open. Obviously obsessed with impressing Apocalypse by capturing the son of Magneto, Abyss abandoned his main goal of stopping the evacuation and allowed it to occur. He met Quicksilver but was unable to defeat the X-Men leader. Quicksilver was able to save the kidnapped boy and defeat Abyss with the help of his fellow X-Man, Storm.",
