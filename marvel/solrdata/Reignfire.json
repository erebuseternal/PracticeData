    "powers": "Reignfire originally existed in an amorphous, a sexual, ebony protoplasmic form; he can apparently temporarily accure additional mass to replicate another after exposure to his/her DNA. After duplicating Sunspot's form and powers, he could metabolize solar energy, using it to enhance his own strength enabling his to lift 50 tons and augmenting his endurance, as well as re-channeling it into concussive force blast. He could produce heat sufficient enough to melt bullets, or create downward thrust which allowed him to fly at incredible speeds. He could drain the heat from the bodies of others, causing hypothermia. Before Cable weakened their telepathic link, Reignfire could control Sunspot through it. After being reduced back to protoplasm, proved able to engulf Sunspot and control him in that way; it is unconfirmed if Reignfier's liquid form might have been able to control others who it did not have a telepathic bond with in a similar fashion.",
