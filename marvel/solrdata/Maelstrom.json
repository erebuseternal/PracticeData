    "content": "Phaedar eventually mated with a woman named Morga, of the Deviants, a genetically unstable sub-species. They raised Maelstrom in Deviant Lemuria in his early years, but Morga was put to death for having relations with an outsider, and Maelstrom was made a slave. Phaedar eventually rescued Maelstrom, but he was now as much against the Deviants as his father was against the Inhumans.One of Maelstrom and Phaedar\u2019s associates, Dr. Hydro, had been provided with a sample of the Terrigen Mist which grants Inhumans their powers, and he used it to transform people into amphibians (\u201cHydro-Men\u201d). When the Inhumans sought to cure the Hydro-Men, they were surprised to find that their Terrigan Mist was involved, and with the aid of Mr. Fantastic, created an Anti-Terrigan Mist Compound, which would undo its effects. When Maelstrom learned of the compound\u2019 invention, he sent his minions to obtain a sample. Although the minions obtained the sample, they could not avoid capture; Maelstrom had Deathurge kill them to prevent their immanent interrogation, and then resurrected them in new clone bodies. Regardless, his actions put the Thing and the Inhumans on his trail, and they invaded Maelstrom\u2019s lab. Phaedar died in his sleep while Maelstrom was battling Black Bolt, the son of Agon, and Maelstrom had Deathurge kill his current body so that he could escape the conflict in an new one. He destroyed his laboratory so that the Inhumans could not study it.In a new body, Maelstrom stole into Olympia, city of the Eternals, as the Eternals were gathering their population to join their forms together into the Uni-Mind. Maelstrom created a device to siphon the Uni-Mind\u2019s kinetic energies into himself, but the Avengers defended the Eternals, releasing them from the Uni-Mind. When Starfox attempted to use his powers to make Maelstrom surrender, Maelstrom had himself slain by Deathurge again.In his next scheme, Maelstrom used knowledge gleaned from the Uni-Mind to construct a device which would siphon the entire Earth\u2019s kinetic energy into himself, gradually slowing its rotation and tearing the planet apart. Opposing him, the Avengers forced him to absorb more energy than he could contain, spreading his molecules across the universe. As Maelstrom began to draw his body back together again, he encountered the cosmic being Kronos and learned of the abstract powers that governed the universe from him. Maelstrom sought out the entity Anomaly and slew it, assuming its role in the cosmic universe, and made a formal alliance with Oblivion, offering up the universe to his patron.Trying to prevent Maelstrom from taking cosmic awareness from Eon, Quasar\u2019s spirit destroyed Eon\u2019s brain, but Maelstrom had already achieved his goal. With his newfound powers, Maelstrom slowed the Earth\u2019s rotation, and then set out to destroy the universe by halting all movement, generating a massive black hole. Maelstrom confronted many of the universe\u2019s great powers to revel in his superiority over them, including Thanos, then-wielder of the six Infinity Gems. Quasar continued to oppose Maelstrom. Their battle carried them over a black hole, whose forces crushed Maelstrom.The cosmic entity Infinity chose Quasar as her champion against Oblivion, and Oblivion summoned forth Maelstrom\u2019s spirit to battle Quasar to determine the fate of the universe. Quasar bested Maelstrom when he demonstrated that, due to an alteration Origin had made to him when she recreated him earlier, he himself had become an anomaly, and therefore challenged Maelstrom\u2019s role as Anomaly. Maelstrom died, and the black hole ceased to exist.Maelstrom\u2019s minions and the Weird Sisters attempted to revive him using captured Deviants whose kinetic energy he could drain. The Eternals and the Fantastic Four joined together to halt Maelstrom\u2019s resurrection, but when he learned that one of the Deviants was Ransak the Reject, his own son, he refused to take his life, and shrank into the Microverse.",
