            "content": "In Russia the computer Quasimodo offered to make Rom human again, by cloning him; Quasimodo then stole Rom\u2019s vacant body-armor, while the clone realized his body was rapidly decaying. Doctor Dredd and Brandy teleported in and attacked \u201cRom\u201d, unaware of the switch. Brandy came to her senses after killing \u201cRom\u201d (actually driving Quasimodo out of the armor), while the clone slew Doctor Dredd. With the assistance of Gremlin, Rom was restored and the Spaceknights, along with Brandy returned to Clairton, West Virginia, where the Wraiths had replaced the town\u2019s key people; including Steve, Torpedo, and Brandy\u2019s parents. The Spaceknights were ambushed, and trapped in a shadow dimension. Traumatized by her loss, Brandy turned ruthless and vengeful, morphing her armor into a more warlike configuration, and broke the Spaceknights free. After being freed the Spaceknights cleansed Clairton of the Wraith infestation. Later Brandy was stripped of her Spaceknight armor by the human-Wraith Hybrid. After banishing the capture Wraith army, Rom said farewell to Brandy and departed Earth. Sometime later the Beyonder briefly restored Brandy\u2019s Starshine powers, before sending her in human form to Galador to be with Rom.",
