    "content": "Gwen came to Empire State University from Standard High School, where she had been the resident \"beauty queen\". Arriving at ESU, she and fellow science major Harry Osborn befriended jock Flash Thompson. Flash attempted to introduce Harry and Gwen to Peter, his high school classmate, during their first chemistry lab. When a preoccupied Peter unintentionally ignored Flash and his new friends, popular Gwen and wealthy Harry did not take kindly to the perceived snub. Spitefully, Harry sabotaged Peter's lab experiment - setting the stage for a rocky start to their eventual friendship.Over time, Peter reconciled with Gwen, Harry, and Flash - transcending his reputation as a standoffish scholarship student. Despite her friends' misgivings about the bookish Peter, Gwen's intuition to her there was more to him than met the eye.Gwen's emotional breakthrough occurred after Peter turned up at ESU one day on his new motorcycle - a move that greatly surprised her and the rest of the gang. Having just defeated the Green Goblin, Peter was riding high - and for once, free of his many problems. Re-examining her previously held opinion, Gwen found in her heart a true romantic attraction - one Peter clearly returned.Their budding relationship was immediately tested by the arrival of Mary Jane Watson - the spunky glamorous niece of Aunt May's friend, Anna Watson. An aspiring model, Mary Jane quickly fell in with Peter's crowd and showed an interest in the young man she had been watching for some time - causing tension between her and Gwen. But Mary Jane was far too wild and free to settle her heart on any one man, and Gwen knew right away Peter was the one for her. The pair soon surrendered to their irresistible love.The Kingpin of crime brainwashed Capt. Stacy into stealing police records. After Peter published pictures exposing Stacy, the Kingpin kidnapped George and Gwen. Spider-Man and Norman Osborn (then an amnesiac to his escapades as the Green Goblin) rescued the two, though the Kingpin escaped. Subsequently, Gwen visited Norman to thank him for saving her and her father's lives. She found Norman despondent, yet powerfully alluring and charismatic. Feeling both sympathetic and attracted to Osborn, a spontaneous affair between the two ensued, leaving Gwen pregnant with twins.Tragically, Gwen's father was killed protecting an innocent child during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. In his dying breath, George revealed that he knew who Spider-Man was beneath the mask, asking him to watch over Gwen. A bereaved Gwen held the hero responsible for her father's death. Peter withdrew while Gwen raged against his alter-ego. With her relationship with Peter in turbulence, and lacking parents at home, Gwen accepted the invitation of her Uncle Arthur and Aunt Nancy to live with them in London. Unable to reconcile how to convince Gwen to stay knowing she would ultimately find out he was secretly the person she hated, Peter let Gwen leave, while she silently hoped Peter would propose marriage to her. However, before long, Peter was unable to bear being without her, and flew to London on assignment with the Daily Bugle, to convince Gwen to return. But an appearance of Spider-Man made the local papers, and Peter returned home fearing an obvious connection would be made. Despite his failed attempt to see Gwen, his heroic deeds convinced Arthur that Spider-Man couldn't be responsible for his brother's death. Listening to her uncle, and realizing she may have expected too much of Peter, Gwen returned home again, certain she could salvage her relationship. She was met by Peter's welcoming arms. During her absence, Norman became the Green Goblin again, Harry turned to L.S.D. while Mary Jane, his supposed girlfriend, blatantly flirted with Peter.Once Norman Osborn again recovered his memory of Peter's secret identity, he burned with a desire for revenge against Spider-Man. Gwen, now aware of her pregnancy, fled to Europe where she secretly carried the twins to full term after only a seven month gestation, giving birth to Gabriel and Sarah. Osborn arranged to provide for the twins in Paris while Gwen returned home and reunited with Peter. Gwen argued with Norman that she should raise the children, assuming that Peter's love would enable him to overlook her infidelity and they would marry. Gwen confided only in Mary Jane, who had overheard the argument and promised to keep her secret. Osborn planned to raise the children to be heirs to the Goblin legacy. Hitting the wall-crawler where it would hurt most, and to rid himself of a young nuisance, the Goblin kidnapped Gwen and carried her to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man arrived and was horrified to find the woman he loved in the hands of his nemesis. Spider-Man blazed into battle, but his ferocity was not enough to prevent the Goblin from pushing Gwen off the bridge. In his last desperate act to save his beloved, Spider-Man fired a slender web-line that caught Gwen by her ankle, stopping her fall before she hit the water. Her neck snapped. Raising her up, Spider-Man discovered she was already dead. The Goblin taunted him, saying that Gwen had been killed by the shock of the fall before he caught her.Even though after Gwen's murder, Spider-Man's subsequent confrontation with the Green Goblin ended in Norman's apparent death at the hands of his own remote-controlled Goblin Glider, Peter's anguish did not die so readily. Several years have passes since her death yet Peter is still tormented by nightmares, and has agonized over how he might have saved Gwen's life if he had done something differently. Peter's love for Gwen lives on in his memory, and deep within his heart, even though his love for Mary Jane has long since become the guiding force in his life. Peter recently used money he was paid to protect a corrupt mob boss named Forelli from Digger, a monstrous undead gamma-spawned creature, to establish a memorial library in Gwen Stacy's name. When the Scarlet Witch's powers transformed the entire world into an alternate reality set under the rule of Magneto (the House of M), Peter and Gwen were married and had a child, Richard. That reality terminated, and life was returned back to the current reality (Earth 616) with the majority of the world unaware of what had transpired.",
