It could shift an entire planets' population into a state of transcendental bliss, uniting their minds in perfect harmony, but at the same time robbing them of independent thought and free will. S'Met'Kth needed to be within a planet's atmosphere to cause the change, but  once a planet is affected, its inhabitants remained in that state until S'Met'Kth was incapacitated (or possibly only if he was slain).",
