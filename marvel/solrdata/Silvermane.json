            "content": "Silvermane\u2019s organization was once allied with Hydra where he was the criminal mastermind behind the temporary fall of the Kingpin, but his criminal activities mainly deal in international drug manufacturing and trafficking operation. At one time, Silvermane had a chemist trying to manufacture a synthetic form of heroin. The chemist took in runaways and experimented with the drug on them, but almost all of them died. Two of the teenagers did survive, but the drugs had altered them into the super humans known as Cloak and Dagger.  Once these two vigilantes found out that it was Silvermane\u2019s organization behind their transformation, they set out for revenge. Spider-Man tried to protect Manfredi, but Dagger used her light daggers to give Silvermane a heart attack. Silvermane was saved from death when his brain was placed in a robotic body making him more than human. The mob boss turned cyborg hunted down his would-be killers leaving Spider-Man to try and save Cloak and Dagger\u2019s lives. The fight led to the subway and Silvermane got past Spider-Man and almost took revenge on Cloak, but Dagger used her light knives to seemingly kill Silvermane again.The Kingpin had the Rose set up a phony drug deal to attract the attention of Cloak and Dagger in order to lure Silvermane back into the Kingpin\u2019s clutches, but it also brought Spider-Man and the Black Cat to the scene. During a struggle over Dagger, the Answer came up with the theory that Dagger\u2019s light may be able to cure the ailing Vanessa Fisk, and he swooped down to procure her for his employer. Cloak teleported after them, but not before Silvermane could jump inside Cloak\u2019s dark force cape. Dagger was taken to the Kingpin\u2019s penthouse, but her energy was too depleted to help his wife. It seemed there wouldn\u2019t be enough time for her to regenerate her powers as Silvermane attacked determined to get his light back. Cloak soon arrived, but in his weakened stare was no match for the Answer. The Kingpin was defeated by Silvermane and Spider-man couldn\u2019t stop him either. It was the Answer that saved the day when he sacrificed himself in order to restore Dagger\u2019s light so that she may return what Manfredi is longing for. Dagger did give Silvermane his light allowing his intelligence to resurface, and then she healed her partner, Cloak. Silvermane, confused, left the penthouse, and the Kingpin blamed Spider-man and the Black Cat when Cloak and Dagger refused to help his wife.During a gang war, Jack-O-Lantern attempted to assassinate Silvermane, but only destroyed his bionic body. Silvermane\u2019s head continued to survive and was secured in an abandoned Hydra base until a new body could be fashioned. Silvermane used an android commando squad to defeat Spider-Man and bring him to his underground headquarters. There he planned to drain Spider-Man of his blood in order to become stronger than ever before, and in doing so he would use his powers to place himself as an Underworld leader. Spider-Man managed to free himself, but was too injured to do any serious harm to his captor. The Black Cat arrived to provide a timely rescue, and Silvermane\u2019s headquarters was severely damaged during the resulting brawl. Silvermane tried to salvage footage of Spider-Man\u2019s secret identity, but was destroyed along with the tape when his lab exploded. It was soon revealed that the obliterated Silvermane was merely an android and the true Silvermane was alive and well.Joseph Manfredi, son of Silvermane, was affiliated with a group called Heavy Mettle and was having problems with the newly reformed New Warriors. Silvermane told his son that the other families didn\u2019t think Joe could handle the super teens, but Joe told his father not to worry. Silvermane told his son that if he was embarrassed again, he would take Joe out himself. Eventually, Maggia business took Silvermane to a riverfront warehouse to a secret meeting with other Maggia leaders across the country. The meeting was called by the Grim Reaper in order to unite the families, but before business could be concluded the Avengers arrived and captured at least three of the top members. It is unknown if Silvermane was among those captured. Even if he was, it may have been an android duplicate considering he was present in human form instead of his cyborg body.",
