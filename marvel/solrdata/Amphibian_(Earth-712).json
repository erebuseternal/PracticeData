The deeper he goes the stronger he gets and the tougher his skin becomes. Amphibian can also see through the murky depths of the ocean and has some form of telepathy allowing him to communicate with marine life such as dolphins. He can presumably travel at great speeds while in the water, but the exact speed is unknown. Outside of water Amphibian has superhuman strength allowing him to lift ten tons and his skin is superhumanly tough.",
