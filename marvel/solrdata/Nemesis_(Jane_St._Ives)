Several members of Gamma joined with Alpha; however, Nemesis did not, vanishing again and taking her feral teammate, Wild Child, with her. After helping Wild Child reclaim his humanity by becoming the hero Weapon Omega, Nemesis was captured by the Children of The Night, a band of sewer-dwelling children that she had once led. Their new leader, Roc, sought to defeat Nemesis but with Weapon Omega\u2019s aid she overpowered him. When the chaos entity Carcass was freed, Nemesis, one of the heroes summoned by Shaman, traveled to the land of the dead to destroy the creature.",
