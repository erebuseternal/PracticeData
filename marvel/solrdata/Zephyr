During her quest to secure the scarab Zephyr mentally enslaved the Living Mummy (N'Kantu) sending him to Earth to recover the scarab. The Mummy was delayed in his efforts by the Living Pharaoh (Ahmet Abdol) and Rich Harper a thief known as Asp. Zephyr journeyed to Earth herself to obtain the babble. The other Elementals seeing Zephyr as an inferior being grew tired of her slow performance, and also journeyed to Earth, where they bound Zephyr along with their human captives. Zephyr allied herself with Asp against her brethren.",
