As they returned from the mission, Captain Britain was lost in the timestream. This severely affected his lover, Meggan, who entered a fugue state, remaining unmoving in a waterfall. Feeling the empath's pain, Feron attempted to contact and help her, but he was overwhelmed by her pain and turned into water himself, loosing his corporeal form for a time.",
