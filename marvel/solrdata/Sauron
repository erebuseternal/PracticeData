Ultimately reverting to his Sauron form, he usurped the leadership of the Savage Land Mutates and opposed Ka-Zar, Spider-Man, and the X-Men. Defeated, he reverted to human form again and was reunited with Tanya. Later, he and Tanya were captured by the Toad who was seeking recruits for a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Forced to absorb Tanya\u2019s energy (possibly fatally), Lykos was transformed into Sauron again and joined the Brotherhood in opposing first X-Force and then X-Factor. After the Brotherhood disbanded, Sauron returned to the Savage Land and, with the Mutates, opposed various members of the X-Men. Capturing Cyclops and Havok, Sauron drained their energies which caused him to mutate further. Jean Grey engaged Sauron telepathically, allowing Lykos\u2019 personality to force his alter ego\u2019s psyche in making a suicide leap into the abyss of his own mind, thus reducing Sauron\u2019s physical form to a pure, animal-like state.",
