Freed when Franklin Richards destroyed the re-formed Mephisto, Topaz was restored by Doctor Strange and the alien sorcerer Urthona, who had captured her soul fragment after it had been released from Hell. Now twenty-one, she achieved her full potential, healing Strange's fatally wounded servant Wong. When Strange turned to black magic to oppose the demon Shuma-Gorath, Topaz left him to study under the Sisters of Glastonbury Tor. Returning to help Strange against Dormammu, she was soon possessed by Mephisto's daughter, Mephista, who was in turn used as a pawn by rival Hell lord, Satannish. Strange ultimately exorcised the demons from Topaz.",
