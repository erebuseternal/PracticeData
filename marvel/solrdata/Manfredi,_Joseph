When the organization arranged the kidnapping of Foggy Nelson, at the time one of New York\u2019s District Attorneys, Daredevil tracked the culprits to their headquarters. Silvermane revealed his role as Supreme Hydra, and his son tried to stop Daredevil but was unsuccessful.Later, when Silvermane\u2019s mansion was taken over by the Red Skull, Blackwing teamed up with Jack O\u2019Lantern to stake it out. When Captain America also came to investigate, the two villains jumped him, viciously attacking him even when he was on the ropes due to Jack O\u2019Lantern\u2019s hallucinogenic gas. The Red Skull had been observing the battle and was impressed enough to order Mother Night to recruit the two for his Skeleton Crew. Mother Night arranged for Captain America to see an illusion that the Scourge of the Underworld killed the villains, and Blackwing and Jack O\u2019Lantern agreed to join the Skull\u2019s Crew.Blackwing served as a member of Crew, fighting off Crossbones and Diamondback before the two joined them as well. He also tried to fight off Captain America and the Falcon when the heroes came to rescue Diamondback. He was defeated by the Falcon and remanded to custody along with many others of the Crew.Blackwing next appeared as a member of the Crimson Cowl\u2019s Masters of Evil, joining the team\u2019s attempt to extort the world\u2019s governments with the use of a weather manipulation machine. The team was tracked down by the Thunderbolts and defeated, with Blackwing and most of its members captured.",
