At first reluctant, Dr. Stillwell couldn\u2019t say no to such a donation and proceeded with the experiment. He decided to give Gargan the powers of a scorpion but wasn\u2019t sure of the side-effects that this would have on his brain. Nevertheless, Gargan drank the serum and proceeded with the rest of the experiment. Dr. Stillwell also created a scorpion suit equipped with a powerful electro-mechanical tail. Gargan\u2019s transformation was now complete.",
