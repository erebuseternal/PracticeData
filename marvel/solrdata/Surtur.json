The second time Surtur was set free by Marduk of the Sons of Satannish, a cult of human demon-worshippers.  Surtur was banished to some unnamed netherworld at the end of that encounter.  He appeared, yet again, in what was to be one of the Asgardians greatest battles against Surtur.  Surtur hatched a plan to lure Asgard's armies to Earth leaving the city vulnerable to attack.  He crossed Bifrost with his newly forged Twilight blade believing Asgard to be defenseless; Odin, Thor and Loki were there to make a last stand to defeat Surtur.   Their victory did not come easy though, as Odin fell along with Surtur into a dimensional rift.",
