The Dragon Man used his breath and his flight to fight them off until the Invisible Girl pinned him with her powers and tried to comfort him as a friend. But before it could fully respond to her touch, Diablo returned and attacked the four, escaping to Dead Man\u2019s Lake with Gilbert and his creation. There, Gilbert bemoaned the use his creation was put to though he was powerless to stop Diablo. But the creature itself turned on Diablo and stopped him from destroying the Fantastic Four with a freezing pellet, accidentally freezing the lake instead. Then the creature chased Diablo across the lake until they both fell into the freezing waters.",
