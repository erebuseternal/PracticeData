Kevin Ford, however, believed his powers were gone, and grabbed Laurie's arm in celebration. Unfortunately, he was wrong, and Laurie's arm shriveled. Even Elixir's powers could not restore her, though it did seem to bring Laurie closer to Josh. Laurie was obviously excluded from training activities for this period. Then, after the human ex-students's bus was bombed, Laurie was speaking with Josh, trying to find out why he was so angry, and she was shot in the head by a Purifier sniper working for Reverend Stryker.",
