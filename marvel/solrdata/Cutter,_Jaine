While doing so, she accompanied Hellstorm to Jack Wintergarden\u2019s demonically possessed mansion in Florida. Breaking in, they encountered the Bailiff of Inanna, demoness of the Inspiration of Madness, who had been torturing the mansion\u2019s inhabitants. Goading Jaine into attacking him, the Bailiff captured and prepared to torture her, but he was destroyed by Hellstorm. When an angry Inanna appeared, Jaine slew the arch-demon with her Breathing Gun; aware that Hellstorm had to be a lord of Hell to have slain the Bailiff, she then threatened to kill him too, worried she had been sleeping with the enemy. Hellstorm informed her of his origins and his recent ascension to Hell\u2019s throne, but assured her he had no intention of conquering the Earth, before officially making her his Satanic Consort.",
