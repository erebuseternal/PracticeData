    "content": "Years later, as young adults, Miguel and Xina dated until Miguel cheated on her with Gabriel\u2019s girlfriend, Dana D\u2019Angelo. In time, Miguel and Dana were engaged. Confident and smugly self-assured, Miguel became project head of the genetics program of Alchemax, performing research inspired by the Spider-Man of the Heroic Age involving alterations of animal\u2019s genetic structure. Told he was poisoned by Tyler Stone with an addictive drug called Rapture for quitting after Alchemax fatally used a criminal as a test subject to expedite research, Miguel tried to purge his body clean on a genetic level. Once the drug was bound to his system, he would need it for the rest of his life. Since only Alchemax legally sold the drug, Miguel would have been forced to continue employment at Alchemax or buy the drug through the black market. His experiment to genetically rest his body was sabotaged by his jealous supervisor, Aaron Delgato, accidentally endowing Miguel with fantastic spider-like abilities. After an explosion in the lab, Delgato apparently fell to his death while Miguel fled, realizing his new powers as he avoided the Alchemax sponsored Public Eye security patrol. A Thor worshipper aided Miguel\u2019s escape, deeming \u201cSpider-Man\u2019s\u201d return as an omen of his god\u2019s return. Tyler Stone hired the cyborg bounty-hunter named Venture to investigate the incident. With Venture in pursuit, Miguel returned to his Babylon Towers apartment, and concealed his identity in a full body costume acquired at a Mexican Day of the Dead festival. After a fierce assault, Spider-Man shredded Venture\u2019s circuitry. Upon recounting the events to his quirky holo-agent (holographic assistant) Lyla, Miguel realized his uncertain future.After another battle with the Vulture, Miguel\u2019s world was turned upside-down as he switched places with the Spider-Man (Peter Parker) of the Heroic Age of Earth-616, waking up next to Peter\u2019s wife, Mary Jane, due to Fujikawa (in the Modern Age) and Stark-Fujikawa (in 2099) running experiments on a temporal energy generator. While Peter tackled the Vulture of 2099, Miguel faced Venom (Eddie Brock). The two Spider-Men were united to face the twisted time-traveling Hobgoblin of the year 2211 (Robin Borne) from the alternate universe of Earth-9500. Hobgoblin\u2019s father, Spider-Man (Max Borne) deflected her Retcon bombs into the generations and the ensuing explosion sent everyone back to their respective universes.In the weeks that followed, Miguel became more comfortable in his role as a costumed defender. He halted the attacks of the hyper-adaptable Mutagen (Gerald Bernardson), protected the city from disaster from a reawakened Cold War Russian super soldier, Chernobyl, wrestled himself free from electronically transmitted mind control by Macroware software developer Dr. Damian Fawcett, clashed with a specially trained agent heavily armed with SItuation Emergency GEar (SIEGE), and defended Dana from the monstrous Man-Spider (Antoine Tarantella). The mysterious amnesiac Net Prophet (formerly Justice, John Roger Tensen of Earth-148611) was liberated from Interspace after the Virtual Unreality experiments of Euromax transfer, the pretentious scientist Jordan Boone, lured the nigh-unstoppable Thanatos (a Destiny-Force powered megalomaniac Rick Jones of Earth-9309) to Alchemax, where he kidnapped Tyler Stone and Spider-Man, and after the two defended Dana\u2019s sister, Father Jennifer D\u2019Angleo, in Downtown against the Fenris gang, Tensen opted to explore the world.Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell) and a critically injured Starfox of the Heroic Age of Earth-616 were sent to 2099. After encountering Spider-Man, Captain Marvel located Miguel to act as their guide. At Alchemax they battled Thanatos, sending the three into the Dystopian alternate future of Earth-9200 ruled by evil future Hulk, Maestro, the other heroes defeated Thanatos, returning everyone back to their original timeline.When Spider-Man battled the savage Bloodsword and the Fenris gang Downtown, back home Lyla began malfunctioning, while at Alchemax Stone made romantic advances towards Dana. Upon his return, Miguel with Dana visited Alchemax\u2019s floating city, Valhalla, where it appeared that Thor and Heimdall had returned, though lacking the nobility of their Heroic Age counterparts. Alchemax CEO, Avatarr, had transformed ordinary people into the Aesir, loyal to the corporation, in order to eliminate the rising super heroic interferance. With help from Doom, Ravage, Punisher (Jake Gallows), the X-Men and Loki ( a transformed Jordan Boone), the Aesir were defeated.While Miguel tried to get back to a normal life, Lyla attacked Dana out of apparent jealously. She and the rest of the city were victims of the mad cyberspace entity named Discord, trying to \"ease humanity into Armageddon\". After saving Stark-Fujikawa\u2019s head, Hikaru-Sama, Miguel joined Gabriel (as \u201cFirelight\u201d) in Cyberspace and defeated Discord. Afterwards, Gabriel admitted to his brother that he knew his secret identity from the start, recognizing the costume from the Mexican festival. Meanwhile, Kasey was kidnapped by SIEGE for Stark-Fujikawa and, as a repayment of Hikaru-Sama\u2019s debt, transformed into Payback, a cyborg warrior designed to be a worthy associate of Spider-Man. Fighting against Risque, Venture\u2019s cyborg sister, Payback failed, leaving Spider-Man alone to defeat the villain. Gabriel was beaten by Alchemax\u2019s Flyboys as they arrested Kasey. While Miguel eavesdropped, Conchatta confronted Tyler to release Kasey, Blackmailing him with evidence that he killed his ex-wife, Nancy. There, Miguel learned the truth that the Rapture he was given was only a short-lasting simulation-and that Tyler Stone was really his father. Miguel left profoundly disturbed.Xina, Lyla\u2019s creator, repaired the holo-agent, spitefully programming her to insult Dana. Offended, Dana accused the emotionally raw Miguel of dating Xina again; after an explosive fight, Miguel and Dana broke up. Later, Spider-Man battled the mercenary android Vlad the Impaler targeting a boy named Gedde Ohara (mistakenly believed by Miguel to be targeting his brother Gabriel O\u2019 Hara), and after Woodstock 2099 fought against Major Jones, a dealer peddling a metamorphosis-enabling drug called Chameleon. For a vacation, Miguel and Xina visited Nightshade, an independent corporation run by their old headmistress, Angela, when Alchemax performed a literal hostile takeover via Mr. Pembert, the Corporate  Headhunter, and the six Corporate Raiders. Though the monstrous genetically manipulated ex-Flyboy, Sgt. Rico Estevez (Subject 394, a.k.a Travesty), and Spider-Man defended Nightshade, the Raiders succeeded, killing Angela in the process. Packrat and his scavenger gang of Foragers descended upon the ruins of Nightshade, kidnapping Spider-Man. The gang offered Spider-Man a means of freedom if he fixed an old robot named Junior. The android, apparently the inert body of a Super-Adaptoid, recognized something in Spider-Man, and awakened as an amalgam of O\u2019 Hara\u2019s Spider-Man with Spider-Man and Venom from the Heroic Age. Calling itself Flipside, it behaved like an emotionally unstable psychopath. Heroically, Spider-Man saved his captors life, leaving Flipside shredded and decapitated; however, after Spider-Man departed, Filpside reassembled itself and resumed its assault on Packrat\u2019s gang. On Miguel\u2019s walk home through the desert, he was assaulted and exhausted, having a horrific nightmare before Xina rescued him.Miguel and Xina attempted another vacation in Mexico City, where they ran into Gabriel and Kasey (who believed Gabe was secretly Spider-Man). There a man named Fernando Morgez performed an arcane ritual to revive his dead sister Anita, inadvertently summoning zombies from a local graveyard instead. Spider-Man, temporarily blinded by Morgez\u2019 spell due to his sensitive eyes, teamed with the Sorceress Supreme, Strange, to end the undead invasion. Distraught over his failure  to make amends for his sister\u2019s accidental death, Morgez committed suicide. The four returned back home seeking some normalcy; instead, they found the country had been overtaken by Doom, who sent federal officers to abduct Miguel from Xina\u2019s car. Taken to the White House, Miguel impressed President Doom with his confidence. With all megacorps nationalized under Doom\u2019s control and Avartarr dead, Tyler Stone became Doom\u2019s corporate Minister, while Stone offered Miguel his seat as CEO of Alchemax. Later, as Spider-Man assisted protesting Spiderites brutalized by federal Watchdogs, Doom offered him a cabinet position as Minister of Supernormal Affairs. Disgusted with Tyler and his dubious relationship with Dana, Conchatta surprised Tyler at his apartment and shot him twice.Meanwhile, Downtown, the Vulture and the mysterious Goblin attacked Kasey Nash, out to prove Spider-Man was allied with Alchemax and the corporate establishment. Summoned Downtown by Gabriel, Spider-Man battled the Goblin. Struggling against the Goblin\u2019s hallucinogenic attack, Spider-Man barely escaped with his life. The Goblin rallied Downtown\u2019s citizen\u2019s against Spider-Man by projecting images of Spider-Man (taken out of context) implicating him as a corporate flunky. Spider-Man left, disgusted by the ingratitude, to find President Doom\u2019s sovereignty at an end as evident by fragments of his Environmental Maintenance Platforms (EMPs) fallen from the sky.After Dana\u2019s funeral, wheelchair bound Tyler Stone attempted to return as CEO of Alchemax. Miguel refused to yield, stating his intention to run a compassionate corporation to serve people, and ejected Stone from the building. Tyler\u2019s attempt to shock Miguel with the knowledge of his paternity had no effect. Miguel discovered that his time as Spider-Man had brought out the best in him, and it was time to become a hero out of costume as well. At Alchemax, Miguel was joined by his brazen mother as the best candidate for his personal assistant, handling even the violent Grunt Union representative, Boru.Union problems became a minor issue for Miguel when communications with the New Atlantis project, Alchemax\u2019s undersea research and habitation endeavor, were severed. Miguel learned that Alchemax had been exploiting the undersea mutates, using them for slave labour. The mutates, under leadership of one called Marriner, broke free; and Roman, who modeled himself after the legendary Sub-Mariner, rebelled. Torn between corporate loyalties and ethical treatment of the mutates, Miguel opted to attempt peaceful negotiations; however, Roman took the initiative to launch an offensive, flooding Nueva York and dispatching a leviathan, Giganto. Spider-Man incapacitated and captured Sub-Mariner, and sent the sea-monster home. Via holovid, Tyler confronted Conchata about her assassination attempt, telling Miguel he\u2019s his father, and admitting he knew all along Miguel was Spider-Man. These revelations, however, actually brought Miguel and his mother closer.Trying to reach Jennifer from the flooded Downtown, Spider-Man fought the Goblin. The Goblin revealed himself to be Gabriel, motivated by jealously for his brother. Chaos reigned in the city as the Atlanteans waged war while the Vulture set charges to demolish the Alchemax building As Tyler attempted to flee to a Martian colony, he was killed by the Atlantean, General Dagim. As Spider-Man and Fr. Jennifer made their escape, Conchatta was believed to have been killed and Alchemax was destroyed. Miguel later learned that Gabriel was innocent, since a shape-shifter took over Gabriel\u2019s life for a time and played the role of the Goblin. Pronouncement of Conchatta\u2019s death was premature, and she later worked to identify the shapeshifter.After the polar ice caps melted, a massive deluge killed most of the world\u2019s inhabitants. The remnants faced a new threat from space from the techno-organic Phalanx. Spider-Man worked together with Doom, whose foresight ended the invasion at the cost of his life. As society rebuilt itself, Miguel reopened Alchemax and married Xina, Together they reawakened Steve Rogers,  offering him Thor\u2019 hammer, Mjolnir. Jettisoned into space, Rogers passed Mjolnir back to Miguel, deemed worthy to lift the hammer. Though not physically transformed, Miguel became heir to awesome power. Secretly aided by the Cyberspace persona Zero Cochrane 2.0, Miguel ruled for the next thousand years, ushering in an unprecedented age of enlightenment. Peace, morality and progress that spread from Earth to the surrounding worlds. In 3099, Rogers was once again revived and received the hammer, leaving Miguel to retire. Miguel O\u2019 Hara\u2019s journey from a cowardly, arrogant youth to super-hero to galactic leader and icon was at an end.",

He has the proportionate strength and agility of a spider, which allows him to lift 10 times his own body weight, and jump distances of up to 30 feet. His speed and reflexes are also enhanced to superhuman levels. Spinnerets in his forearms enable him to fire organic spider-webbing from the top of his wrists. \nRetractable talons in his fingertips and toes enable him to climb walls or cut enemies. His teeth are venomous, and can paralyze anyone he bites. He has enhanced hearing, and can see in the dark, or long distances. The muscles controlling the movement of his eyes are accelerated, which enables him to clearly see fast moving objects without any motion blur. His web cape acts as an air foil, and allows him to glide on air currents for a short period of time.",
