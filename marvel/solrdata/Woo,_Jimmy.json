    "content": "In 1958, the FBI granted Jimmy special powers to assemble a small, secret team of super-powered beings in order to rescue President Eisenhower from the clutches of the Claw. Jimmy recruited Marvel Boy, Venus, the Human Robot, and Gorilla-Man, successfully freeing the President and forced the Claw to escape. These \"G-Men\" operated for another six months, until the government decreed that the country wasn't ready to learn of such a super-team and its exploits.In 1959, Jimmy Woo was promoted to join S.H.I.E.L.D., although it took him out of field work. Years later, he jumped at the chance to return to the field, joining Nick Fury and Captain America to stop the Claw from making Suwan into a being powerful enough to be called his successor. Ultimately, Suwan turned on her granduncle, who forced her to relinquish her power, killing her but restoring his ailing health. Jimmy, brokenhearted, returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. duty.Nearing retirement age, Jimmy became a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Directorate. Secretly, however, he and selected agents had worked without S.H.I.E.L.D. knowledge to track down the Atlas Foundation. He ran into some trouble, however, and his entire team was decimated when opening a secret Foundation chamber.  Jimmy himself was mortally wounded, which prompted S.H.I.E.L.D. to investigate. Gorilla-Man was brought in to answer questions, but he instead spearheaded a reunion of Jimmy's allies. Marvel Boy's alien technology revived Jimmy-- but with a catch. Jimmy was revived as he was in the 1950s, because that was the way Marvel Boy last remembered him.With no memory of recent years, Jimmy Woo and his allies began the search for the Atlas Foundation anew, recruiting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Agent Derek Khanata along the way. They began cracking down on various Atlas fronts, all insidious and formidable. The trail led back to the scene of the massacre that started it all, but now Jimmy realized the true secret of the underground passage.Jimmy and his allies were confronted by Mr. Lao of the Atlas Foundation, a literal dragon working on behalf of Golden Claw. The Claw knew Jimmy to be a true descendant of Genghis Khan, and he revealed that he became Jimmy's greatest enemy in order to help Jimmy build a legend worthy of his lineage. He hoped that Jimmy would take up the mantle of the Khan, restoring his Eternal Empire to its former glory. In fact, Jimmy's adventures with his allies had been set up by the Claw and Mr. Lao from the very beginning, ever since the 1950s!",
