Both heroes finally decided they were on the same side and actively began looking for the actual killer. It wasn't long before Ralph Rider's butler came forward stating he had information leading to the murderer\u2019s identity, and while he was privately speaking with the detective, Photon appeared seeking to take the butler's life. Spider-Man and Nova did their best to stop the vile villain, but Photon got the better of them and was able to permanently silence the butler before making his escape. After that, Dean, Risk and Daze had all disappeared, leaving the heroes stumped.The terrible trio, still suspects of the pending investigation, were awaiting to be transported away by the forces of A.I.M. when Nova and Spider-Man confronted them, but a battle against overwhelming odds, and a timely appearance from Photon, left the do-gooders in dire peril. Chained to an anchor and dropped into the sea, it looked like it was the end for Nova and Spider-Man, but tenacity and super strength proved to be too much for their bonds. They broke free and renewed their pursuit of Photon. They traveled back to Ralph Rider\u2019s home and aided the local law enforcement in defeating A.I.M.'s soldiers, but they were almost behind the eight ball again when Photon took a hostage. The two heroes thought fast and acted even faster, and soon Photon was subdued before he could take the life of another.",
