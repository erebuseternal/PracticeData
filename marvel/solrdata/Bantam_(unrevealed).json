XSE members led by Lucas Bishop, followed the fugitives, seeking to return them to their future domain. Unbeknownst to Bantam he was harboring another fugitive, Mountjoy within his body, Mountjoy separated from Bantam upon arrival. Mountjoy later hunted Bantam for months, wanting to slay the only being aware of his presence on Earth-616. Realizing that he was no match for Mountjoy, Bantam eluded Mountjoy, with the aid of Bishop who was in New York for the evening with the X-Man Storm.",
